Ses01M_script02_1_M032	 It's like a little bit of the unexplainable, a little magic, a little mystery.  I just don't see how you can not be interested in this.	Ses01M-script02-07-01-1_M032.wav	07
Ses03M_script01_1_M012	 That we haven't had any hope for years now?	Ses03M-script01-05-01-1_M012.wav	05

Ses04M_impro07_F014	 That's great.  I mean, I'm really glad you're not going to go anywhere.  You'll still be here.	Ses04M-impro07-07-01-F014.wav	07

Ses03M_impro03_M028	 About two and a half weeks.	Ses03M-impro03-01-01-M028.wav	01
Ses03F_impro06_F022	 Because this other half was just kind of like ripped away.	Ses03F-impro06-04-01-F022.wav	04
Ses03M_script03_2_M007	 Oh, that's a nice point of view I must say.	Ses03M-script03-05-01-2_M007.wav	05

Ses01F_impro05_F025	 I don't want money, I want my clothes.	Ses01F-impro05-05-01-F025.wav	05
Ses03M_script02_2_M019	 Wait a minute.  I've got it.	Ses03M-script02-01-01-2_M019.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_1_F030	 You're a considerate fella and there's nothing wrong in that.	Ses03F-script01-01-01-1_F030.wav	01
Ses01M_script02_1_M043	 Like some little time release fire cracker went off inside their little tiny bodies.  And they all turned as one...	Ses01M-script02-07-01-1_M043.wav	07

Ses01M_script02_2_M035	 You think nothing turns out how it's supposed to.  You think I had some grand idea going that four years down the line.  We would come to this beach and argue over fish?  No.	Ses01M-script02-05-01-2_M035.wav	05
Ses01F_script03_2_F024	 You're quite insufferable, I expect it's because you are drunk.	Ses01F-script03-05-01-2_F024.wav	05
Ses04M_script02_2_F000	 Look at this, goose bumps.	Ses04M-script02-01-01-2_F000.wav	01
Ses05M_impro05_F017	 Uh- Actually, I don't know that that's legal. Um- it is the issue	Ses05M-impro05-01-01-F017.wav	01

Ses01F_script01_3_F006	 Sort of embarrassed ever since I got here.	Ses01F-script01-01-01-3_F006.wav	01
Ses01M_script01_1_M005	 Yeah, I could hear him crying through the floorboards in my room.	Ses01M-script01-04-01-1_M005.wav	04
Ses03M_impro02_F030	 I'm done.  I can't honey.	Ses03M-impro02-04-01-F030.wav	04

Ses04M_script01_1_M026	 I wanted to get this settled first.	Ses04M-script01-01-01-1_M026.wav	01
Ses05M_script03_2_M020	 It's a pity you didn't have a little bit more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.	Ses05M-script03-05-01-2_M020.wav	05
Ses04M_script02_1_F013	 Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach, flop around and then they swim away.  And then they die.	Ses04M-script02-05-01-1_F013.wav	05
Ses04F_script03_2_M031	 Very good idea.  I will.	Ses04F-script03-05-01-2_M031.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_M050	 wicked little beast. And I- I hope I never see you again as long as live.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M050.wav	05
Ses05F_script03_1_M028	 The worst one was in Cannes when your curling irons burnt a hole in my new dressing gown.	Ses05F-script03-07-01-1_M028.wav	07

Ses05M_impro03_M000	 Guess what?	Ses05M-impro03-07-01-M000.wav	07
Ses04M_impro04_F013	 You didn't do what I told you to do.	Ses04M-impro04-01-01-F013.wav	01

Ses01F_impro03_M008	 Yeah.	Ses01F-impro03-01-01-M008.wav	01
Ses05F_script01_2_F017	 I can't help it!	Ses05F-script01-05-01-2_F017.wav	05
Ses04F_script02_1_M038	 They don't know what drives them.  They don't give it a name or ask question.  They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them here to this place	Ses04F-script02-07-01-1_M038.wav	07
Ses04F_impro04_F008	 Yeah but you weren't unemployed for three years trying to find any job.  I mean at this point I'm going to go drive a cab or, you know, work at the gas station or something.  I don't even- I don't know what to do anymore.	Ses04F-impro04-05-01-F008.wav	05
Ses03F_impro06_F020	 Can you imagine, though, you know, as a parent, just losing a kid? Twenty-two years old.	Ses03F-impro06-04-01-F020.wav	04
Ses02M_script02_1_F000	 Fine.	Ses02M-script02-01-01-1_F000.wav	01
Ses03M_impro03_M002	 [LAUGHTER] Guess who just got hitched?	Ses03M-impro03-07-01-M002.wav	07
Ses01M_impro03_F015	 Yeah.  My colors are blush and beige what is it, do you know?	Ses01M-impro03-07-01-F015.wav	07
Ses03F_impro02_F025	 It's going to be okay.	Ses03F-impro02-04-01-F025.wav	04
Ses04M_impro06_M017	 Yeah.	Ses04M-impro06-04-01-M017.wav	04
Ses01F_impro03_F018	 Penny slots. That's what he plays.	Ses01F-impro03-01-01-F018.wav	01
Ses04F_impro03_F017	 Really?	Ses04F-impro03-07-01-F017.wav	07
Ses01M_script01_1_M020	 See.  Then it's not just my business. Sometimes you infuriate me, you know that?  You know it's just your business too if I tell father and he throws a fit about it, huh?	Ses01M-script01-05-01-1_M020.wav	05
Ses03M_impro06_F015	 I'm so sorry.	Ses03M-impro06-04-01-F015.wav	04
Ses01M_script02_2_M003	 Well, so?  What do you think?	Ses01M-script02-07-01-2_M003.wav	07
Ses05M_impro02_F012	 What would be the worst that would happen if they found you somewhere else?	Ses05M-impro02-01-01-F012.wav	01
Ses05M_impro05_F006	 Well, I mean, you know that happens pretty often that sometimes baggage -- -- gets lost.	Ses05M-impro05-01-01-F006.wav	01
Ses03F_impro02_F026	 No, I have to go.	Ses03F-impro02-04-01-F026.wav	04
Ses04M_impro07_M035	 No, I'm not going to go to a football game.	Ses04M-impro07-01-01-M035.wav	01
Ses03M_script02_1_M027	 Okay.  But it's fish that do something that no other fish do.  Like the swallows in Capistrano or the Lemmings that throw themselves off the cliffs, there's magic here and some mystery and a little bit of unexplainable.	Ses03M-script02-07-01-1_M027.wav	07
Ses03M_impro05a_M018	 Calm down?  It's my mother's funeral tomorrow.  I'm the one responsible for this.	Ses03M-impro05a-05-01-M018.wav	05
Ses01M_impro02_M016	 I'm going to be fine too, okay?	Ses01M-impro02-04-01-M016.wav	04
Ses02F_impro08_F023	 Absolutely.  That actually goes in on the same package with our hotel.  You just give me your address.  We'll come and pick up a time that allows you to get to your flight with plenty of time to spare.	Ses02F-impro08-01-01-F023.wav	01
Ses03F_impro08_F008	 But I'm going to definitely have to- uh--get your contact information	Ses03F-impro08-01-01-F008.wav	01
Ses01M_script01_1_F024	 From father's point of view he is not dead and you have no right to take his girl.  I'm just saying that you can go on from there if you know where to go but I'm saying I don't know where to go.  See, I don't know.	Ses01M-script01-05-01-1_F024.wav	05
Ses03F_script02_1_M019	 Right.	Ses03F-script02-01-01-1_M019.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_2_F013	 Nobody in my house better ever dare-dare to challenge her faith. Maybe strangers, but not his father, not his brother.	Ses03F-script01-05-01-2_F013.wav	05
Ses04F_impro03_F003	 Yes.  He finally proposed.  I'm getting married.	Ses04F-impro03-07-01-F003.wav	07
Ses03M_impro08a_M002	 Okay.  Can you give me the last four digits of your social security number so I can verify who I'm speaking with?	Ses03M-impro08a-01-01-M002.wav	01
Ses05M_script01_2_M015	 What's that suppose to mean, me above all?  Look at you, you're shaking.	Ses05M-script01-05-01-2_M015.wav	05
Ses01M_script02_2_F036	 I just can't help wishing that I was somebody, somewhere else.	Ses01M-script02-04-01-2_F036.wav	04
Ses03M_impro05b_M033	 I will never do business with Delta again.	Ses03M-impro05b-05-01-M033.wav	05
Ses02F_script02_2_F017	 And while we were dancing, you said the softest, most intimate things to me right into my ear so that I could feel them as much as hear them.	Ses02F-script02-04-01-2_F017.wav	04
Ses01M_script03_2_M031	 That's a very good idea I think I will.	Ses01M-script03-05-01-2_M031.wav	05
Ses03F_impro07_M021	 I got into film school at the Art Academy.	Ses03F-impro07-01-01-M021.wav	01
Ses03F_script02_1_F010	 Not particularly.	Ses03F-script02-04-01-1_F010.wav	04
Ses01F_impro04_F001	 I don't know.  Isn't that-- that's all like escort services and things like that.	Ses01F-impro04-01-01-F001.wav	01
Ses01F_impro05_M019	 Yes.	Ses01F-impro05-01-01-M019.wav	01
Ses05F_impro07_M001	 Shut up.  What'd you get, where'd you get accepted to? please	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-M001.wav	07
Ses05M_impro07_M023	 yeah.	Ses05M-impro07-07-01-M023.wav	07
Ses04M_script03_1_F026	 It burnt my comb, too, and all the towels in the bathroom.	Ses04M-script03-07-01-1_F026.wav	07
Ses01M_impro05_F011	 Details, Details.  Well, anyhow can I--	Ses01M-impro05-01-01-F011.wav	01
Ses03F_impro04_F002	 I just, I see all these other people getting commercials and work and it's like I'm not getting anything.	Ses03F-impro04-04-01-F002.wav	04
Ses03F_impro03_F012	 Yeah, I said yes, but I, yeah, I mean,	Ses03F-impro03-07-01-F012.wav	07
Ses04F_script03_1_F021	 Thank you, dear.  The same applies to you except that if I catch you so much as looking at another woman, I'll kill you.	Ses04F-script03-07-01-1_F021.wav	07
Ses05F_impro02_F001	 um.	Ses05F-impro02-04-01-F001.wav	04
Ses03F_script02_2_F022	 I told myself finally, this is how happy I'm supposed to be.	Ses03F-script02-04-01-2_F022.wav	04
Ses05F_impro07_F027	 oh yeah.	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-F027.wav	07
Ses01M_impro05_F025	 They do as matter of fact.  We don't like to publicize it because	Ses01M-impro05-01-01-F025.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_3_F025	 No. What is it? Is it your mother?	Ses03F-script01-04-01-3_F025.wav	04
Ses01F_impro05_F015	 Do you have any idea-- fifty dollars?  That's supposed to replace everything that I have?  Do you understand how much I have packed in there? Not only does it have sentimental value; it can't be replaced like that.  It was incredibly expensive.	Ses01F-impro05-05-01-F015.wav	05
Ses02F_script01_2_M008	 How do you know why she's waited?	Ses02F-script01-01-01-2_M008.wav	01
Ses01M_script02_2_M045	 Yeah?	Ses01M-script02-04-01-2_M045.wav	04
Ses03F_script02_1_M040	 its single-mindedness with one mind. Urgency that's pure urge. You know, they don't give it a name.	Ses03F-script02-07-01-1_M040.wav	07
Ses04F_impro04_M007	 You need that- Time-	Ses04F-impro04-01-01-M007.wav	01
Ses04F_impro07_M041	 Wait, you've been there before?	Ses04F-impro07-07-01-M041.wav	07
Ses05M_script02_1_M029	 Oh, this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for the world. I mean, think about this, I know you're not interested but just think about this for a second;	Ses05M-script02-07-01-1_M029.wav	07
Ses02M_script02_1_M014	 Oh, a six-pack, that's, should've brought a -- a six-pack be just the ticket right now. How could I forget,	Ses02M-script02-07-01-1_M014.wav	07
Ses04F_script03_2_M015	 Nothing.	Ses04F-script03-05-01-2_M015.wav	05
Ses03M_script02_2_F031	 I want things to turn out the way that they're supposed to be.	Ses03M-script02-05-01-2_F031.wav	05
Ses02M_script02_2_M025	 Get married again?	Ses02M-script02-01-01-2_M025.wav	01
Ses04M_script01_1_F041	 But don't think that way, you hear me?	Ses04M-script01-05-01-1_F041.wav	05
Ses04F_script03_2_M027	 I'm not in the least drunk.	Ses04F-script03-05-01-2_M027.wav	05
Ses03M_impro06_M023	 It's so fucked up.	Ses03M-impro06-04-01-M023.wav	04
Ses05F_impro04_F022	 That's really hard to hear.	Ses05F-impro04-04-01-F022.wav	04
Ses05F_script03_1_M015	 Who knows?	Ses05F-script03-07-01-1_M015.wav	07
Ses01F_script02_1_M025	 Yeah.  But this..this moment on the beach is like the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping around is laying eggs or what to do - spawning or mating or whatever.	Ses01F-script02-01-01-1_M025.wav	01
Ses03F_impro08_M011	 I- I'm going to kill myself right now.	Ses03F-impro08-05-01-M011.wav	05
Ses05F_script02_2_F029	 I didn't say that.	Ses05F-script02-04-01-2_F029.wav	04
Ses02F_script03_1_M015	 Certainly, you must.  We're figures of fun, alright.	Ses02F-script03-01-01-1_M015.wav	01
Ses01F_script01_3_M005	 Well I was kind of planning of sneaking up on you over the course of a week or so.  They just take it for granted that we're all set.	Ses01F-script01-01-01-3_M005.wav	01
Ses01F_impro02_M005	 I don't know how you can be okay with this?  I don't know why you're not-- you're fine with it.	Ses01F-impro02-04-01-M005.wav	04
Ses02F_impro07_F037	 Thanks.	Ses02F-impro07-07-01-F037.wav	07
Ses05M_impro07_M028	 Not a lot.  I mean, I wouldn't want to live with more than three other people.  So, like four of us total, right?	Ses05M-impro07-07-01-M028.wav	07
Ses05F_impro05_M039	 Well, I have no way to give you more money.  I'm giving you as much money as I can, and figuring- as far as figuring out where you bag is-	Ses05F-impro05-01-01-M039.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_3_F033	 Because you can't feel that way, never again, Chris. You hear me? Never. I mean, the money and me too.	Ses03F-script01-04-01-3_F033.wav	04
Ses01F_script02_2_M000	 Look at this, all of the hairs are standing up on my arm.	Ses01F-script02-07-01-2_M000.wav	07
Ses01M_impro01_M031	 Why, because I'm sick of talking to you.	Ses01M-impro01-05-01-M031.wav	05
Ses02M_impro01_F006	 Um, that you would need to go home and get another form of ID and come back.	Ses02M-impro01-01-01-F006.wav	01
Ses05M_script03_2_F043	 Brute	Ses05M-script03-05-01-2_F043.wav	05
Ses02F_script03_2_F039	 I hate you.  Stop it.  Stop it.  I hate you, do you hear?  You're conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible.	Ses02F-script03-05-01-2_F039.wav	05
Ses05M_impro08_M012	 Okay, And uh- go ahead and click on run.	Ses05M-impro08-01-01-M012.wav	01
Ses05F_impro07_M000	 what	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-M000.wav	07
Ses01F_script01_1_M019	 You know sometimes you infuriate me.  you know that?  Isn't it your business if I tell father and he throws a fit about it?  God, you have such a talent for ignoring things.	Ses01F-script01-05-01-1_M019.wav	05
Ses01F_script02_2_F041	 So maybe we are in the wrong spot, but we are with the right person.	Ses01F-script02-01-01-2_F041.wav	01
Ses04M_script02_2_M001	 What I said.	Ses04M-script02-01-01-2_M001.wav	01
Ses04M_script02_1_F005	 Yes.	Ses04M-script02-05-01-1_F005.wav	05
Ses04F_script01_1_M010	 I don't want to argue with him but it's time that he realizes that Larry's not coming back anymore.	Ses04F-script01-05-01-1_M010.wav	05
Ses05M_script01_3_F015	 Not like that you're not.	Ses05M-script01-07-01-3_F015.wav	07
Ses01M_impro06_F008	 how was sick?	Ses01M-impro06-01-01-F008.wav	01
Ses05F_impro08_M007	 Like I know I paid last month, but it hasn't been paid and you charged me a late fee.	Ses05F-impro08-05-01-M007.wav	05
Ses04M_impro05_M015	 You understand that the contents of my bag- The contents of my bag cost a hundred and fifty dollars.	Ses04M-impro05-05-01-M015.wav	05
Ses03M_impro06_F016	 Well now you can follow his footsteps, you know?  Carry out what he wanted to do.	Ses03M-impro06-04-01-F016.wav	04
Ses01F_impro05_M028	 Um, actually, I don't know. I don't know. Oh really?	Ses01F-impro05-01-01-M028.wav	01
Ses02F_script02_2_F020	 I'd rather not remember some things.  I would rather not hope for some things.	Ses02F-script02-04-01-2_F020.wav	04
Ses02F_impro05_M008	 Right.  No.  I mean they- they might--they might--if you-if you are argue the case more, maybe they'll reimburse you more, but, right now--	Ses02F-impro05-01-01-M008.wav	01
Ses05M_impro01_F004	 No, but this is for um- replacements and you need a new -- whole new license as a California --	Ses05M-impro01-01-01-F004.wav	01
Ses03M_impro07_M017	 This is so exciting.  This is like a new chapter in our lives.	Ses03M-impro07-07-01-M017.wav	07
Ses04F_impro07_F008	 [LAUGHTER] It's safe around there.	Ses04F-impro07-07-01-F008.wav	07
Ses02M_script01_2_M004	 How do you know he's even thinking of it?	Ses02M-script01-01-01-2_M004.wav	01
Ses05M_impro03_F019	 Oh I'm so excited for you.	Ses05M-impro03-07-01-F019.wav	07
Ses05M_script02_1_M023	 All right.  But they are fish that do something no other fish do.  Like the swallows were turning into Capistrano or Lemmings jumping off the cliffs, you know like that. There's- There's magic here and mystery.  And a little bit of the unexplainable.  You know, I can't see how you could not be interested.	Ses05M-script02-07-01-1_M023.wav	07
Ses03F_impro01_M004	 She- she probably doesn't even work here.	Ses03F-impro01-01-01-M004.wav	01
Ses04F_script02_2_F025	 No.	Ses04F-script02-01-01-2_F025.wav	01
Ses05M_impro07_M036	 Loans, scholarships, I've got a lot of scholarships-- Yeah, yeah. I'm- I'm half Native American so I get all those scholarships, too. yeah.	Ses05M-impro07-07-01-M036.wav	07
Ses02F_script03_1_M032	 Oh, I'll never forget his face.	Ses02F-script03-07-01-1_M032.wav	07
Ses04F_impro02_M025	 You want me tell you that I'm okay with it?	Ses04F-impro02-04-01-M025.wav	04
Ses03M_impro08b_M019	 Okay.  They can figure out pink for you.  So go in there and just tell them that and they'll hook you up with other goodies, stuff like that free service, no contract, no nothing.  Just for being a good customer	Ses03M-impro08b-01-01-M019.wav	01
Ses01M_impro06_F027	 Yeah.	Ses01M-impro06-01-01-F027.wav	01
Ses05M_script03_1_M021	 No, no that is quit laughable.  The cutting little mystery all done with mirrors.	Ses05M-script03-07-01-1_M021.wav	07
Ses03F_script01_1_M045	 Yes. I like it an hour out of the day. If I have to grub for money all day long at least that evening I want it beautiful. I want a wife. I want a family. I want some kids. I want to build something I can give myself to.	Ses03F-script01-05-01-1_M045.wav	05
Ses05F_impro04_M031	 Do they seem to like you? I mean, Can you get any read from them?	Ses05F-impro04-01-01-M031.wav	01
Ses05M_impro04_F024	 Fair enough.	Ses05M-impro04-01-01-F024.wav	01
Ses04F_impro04_M021	 you know what I mean? You know, it's like they say presentation is, like eighty percent.	Ses04F-impro04-01-01-M021.wav	01
Ses01M_script01_3_M006	 You did?	Ses01M-script01-01-01-3_M006.wav	01
Ses01M_impro01_F012	 Probably.	Ses01M-impro01-05-01-F012.wav	05
Ses01F_impro04_M002	 No.  There's regular jobs on there.	Ses01F-impro04-01-01-M002.wav	01
Ses05M_script01_1_M016	 You know.	Ses05M-script01-01-01-1_M016.wav	01
Ses03M_impro06_M028	 Working for corporate America?  Wow.	Ses03M-impro06-04-01-M028.wav	04
Ses03F_script01_1_M027	 To hell with that.	Ses03F-script01-05-01-1_M027.wav	05
Ses05F_script01_2_M000	 Why does that bother you?	Ses05F-script01-01-01-2_M000.wav	01
Ses02F_impro08_M012	 All right.  And can they like all get together?	Ses02F-impro08-01-01-M012.wav	01
Ses03F_script02_1_M038	 And they all, all as one, turned as one and formed this line as big as the California coast and started swimming this way. Swimming as if that's the only thing that matters.	Ses03F-script02-07-01-1_M038.wav	07
Ses05M_script02_1_M017	 Honey, it's a natural phenomenon.  I mean, this kind of thing only happens once a year.  It's a great opportunity.	Ses05M-script02-07-01-1_M017.wav	07
Ses03F_impro07_M013	 Oh, Jesus. That is so amazing.	Ses03F-impro07-07-01-M013.wav	07
Ses02M_script01_2_M007	 You can't read her mind.	Ses02M-script01-01-01-2_M007.wav	01
Ses03M_impro05b_F004	 Okay.  Well you um-...	Ses03M-impro05b-01-01-F004.wav	01
Ses03M_impro05a_F016	 Okay.  We will find your luggage.  Apparently because it somehow...what flight you were taking, you were on Delta?	Ses03M-impro05a-01-01-F016.wav	01

I feel like as though my whole life is going to be standing on the beach waiting with my eyes opened expectantly, my hands clasped neatly in front of me, waiting for fish to show up.  And the fish will not show up.	Ses05M-script02-05-01-2_F010.wav	05

Ses01F_script02_1_M015	 Aw.  Do you know, I should have brought a six pack, too.  A six pack, that would be just the ticket right about now.  Huh?	Ses01F-script02-01-01-1_M015.wav	01

Ses04F_script01_1_M009	 You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?	Ses04F-script01-05-01-1_M009.wav	05
Ses05F_script01_3_F024	 Do you still feel like that?	Ses05F-script01-01-01-3_F024.wav	01
Ses05F_impro06_F026	 It's hard to say good-bye.	Ses05F-impro06-04-01-F026.wav	04

Ses03F_script02_1_F003	 I don't understand why you're always saying oh, it's mine, it's mine. It's not like it's just your flashlight. I mean, how do you think that makes me feel?	Ses03F-script02-05-01-1_F003.wav	05
Ses02F_script02_2_M016	 You said, "Hey the grunion are running tonight."  I said, "Great, let's go.  I feel lucky."	Ses02F-script02-01-01-2_M016.wav	01

Ses05M_script03_1_F015	 Well, will we always bicker and fight?	Ses05M-script03-01-01-1_F015.wav	01
Ses04F_script02_1_F019	 We didn't see them the first time either.	Ses04F-script02-05-01-1_F019.wav	05
Ses04F_impro01_M021	 like I said before right now.	Ses04F-impro01-05-01-M021.wav	05

Ses05M_impro05_M002	 Uh- Like, an hour and a half ago.  I talked to somebody who was standing out there and they said wait.  Sometimes like random butt- pieces come out late.	Ses05M-impro05-01-01-M002.wav	01
Ses05M_script01_3_M039	 And I guess that included you.	Ses05M-script01-04-01-3_M039.wav	04
Ses03M_impro06_M010	 You know a stupid case of drunk driving it's just...	Ses03M-impro06-04-01-M010.wav	04
Ses01F_impro05_F028	 Okay.  I'll do that.	Ses01F-impro05-05-01-F028.wav	05
Ses04M_impro04_F001	 What about like a temp agency?	Ses04M-impro04-01-01-F001.wav	01
Ses01M_impro06_F025	 That's a long time.	Ses01M-impro06-01-01-F025.wav	01
Ses02F_script02_1_M028	 Alright.  But it's fish that do something that none of the other fish do.  Like the swallows returning to Capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs.	Ses02F-script02-07-01-1_M028.wav	07
Ses02M_impro08_M030	 you know it gets- it gets difficult you know so Alright.	Ses02M-impro08-01-01-M030.wav	01
Ses05F_script01_3_M035	 It was all like some kind of bus accident to them.  I went back to work with my dad, in that whole rat race again.	Ses05F-script01-04-01-3_M035.wav	04
Ses04M_script01_2_M005	 How do you know he's even thinking about it?	Ses04M-script01-01-01-2_M005.wav	01
Ses02M_script02_1_M013	 You cold, you want my jacket? We should've - we should've brought our blanket, our blanket, how could we forget to bring the blanket?	Ses02M-script02-07-01-1_M013.wav	07
Ses02F_impro08_F011	 Absolutely. we we	Ses02F-impro08-01-01-F011.wav	01
Ses02F_impro07_M007	 Yeah.	Ses02F-impro07-07-01-M007.wav	07
Ses02F_impro06_F013	 You start to lose like that image after a while.	Ses02F-impro06-04-01-F013.wav	04
Ses01M_impro01_M010	 No, I don't have a passport.	Ses01M-impro01-01-01-M010.wav	01
Ses04M_script02_2_F018	 Dancing barefoot in the sand; drinking champagne from the bottle.	Ses04M-script02-04-01-2_F018.wav	04
Ses03M_script01_1_M038	 I'll get out.  I'll marry her somewhere else.  Maybe New York.	Ses03M-script01-01-01-1_M038.wav	01
Ses05M_impro01_F001	 Oh, this- this form that you have is the wrong form.  You need to go over to the other line on the other side of the D.M.V..	Ses05M-impro01-01-01-F001.wav	01
Ses05M_script01_1_F022	 From your father's point of view he's not dead and she's still his girl.  Now, you can go on from there if you know where to go, Chris, but I don't know.  So what can I do for you?	Ses05M-script01-05-01-1_F022.wav	05
Ses04F_impro07_F000	 Guess what came today?	Ses04F-impro07-07-01-F000.wav	07
Ses04F_impro06_M013	 That's right.  That's right.  I mean he would want us to, you know, celebrate the life that he- that he lived and, you know, enjoy the rest of ours as much as we can.	Ses04F-impro06-04-01-M013.wav	04
Ses03F_script02_2_F031	 No.	Ses03F-script02-05-01-2_F031.wav	05
Ses03F_impro02_M020	 I can't be that strong. A whole year.	Ses03F-impro02-04-01-M020.wav	04
Ses04F_script01_3_M036	 And then I came home and it was amazing.	Ses04F-script01-04-01-3_M036.wav	04
Ses05F_script02_2_F005	 God damn it, Augie.  Why do you always ask things like that?  It's so insulting.	Ses05F-script02-05-01-2_F005.wav	05
Ses02M_script03_2_M012	 You can hardly call three liquor glasses in a whole evening going on and on and on.	Ses02M-script03-01-01-2_M012.wav	01
Ses04F_script03_1_M008	 Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy, do they?	Ses04F-script03-07-01-1_M008.wav	07
Ses05M_script02_1_M033	 Well, so what do you think?	Ses05M-script02-07-01-1_M033.wav	07
Ses01F_impro05_M008	 Uh-huh.	Ses01F-impro05-01-01-M008.wav	01
Ses02M_script03_2_F040	 Oh yes I am.	Ses02M-script03-05-01-2_F040.wav	05
Ses04M_script01_1_F036	 You've got a business here.  What the hell is this?	Ses04M-script01-05-01-1_F036.wav	05
Ses04M_impro03_F003	 [LAUGHTER] Well you paint a romantic picture.	Ses04M-impro03-07-01-F003.wav	07
Ses01M_script01_1_F042	 I don't understand you, do I?	Ses01M-script01-05-01-1_F042.wav	05
Ses03M_impro08b_M006	 Is the phone turned on?	Ses03M-impro08b-01-01-M006.wav	01
Ses04F_impro07_M017	 That's ridiculous.  I don't believe that.	Ses04F-impro07-01-01-M017.wav	01
Ses03M_impro05b_F020	 I mean, our airline's fault.  I don't know what happened, misplaced, something happened but we will get you--	Ses03M-impro05b-01-01-F020.wav	01
Ses01F_script02_1_M020	 Right.	Ses01F-script02-01-01-1_M020.wav	01
Ses02M_script01_3_M025	 Well, I lost them.	Ses02M-script01-04-01-3_M025.wav	04
Ses04F_impro07_F024	 So this works out perfectly.  Because I was worried if I didn't get in to U.S.C., then I would have to go somewhere far away and then-	Ses04F-impro07-07-01-F024.wav	07
Ses04F_script03_2_M043	 You're not.	Ses04F-script03-05-01-2_M043.wav	05
Ses03M_impro04_M030	 Maybe I'll just kill myself.	Ses03M-impro04-04-01-M030.wav	04
Ses03F_impro07_M032	 Yeah.	Ses03F-impro07-07-01-M032.wav	07
Ses03F_impro01_F002	 What's wrong?	Ses03F-impro01-01-01-F002.wav	01
Ses03M_script03_2_F003	 No I didn't.  You made up the whole thing in your jealous imagination.	Ses03M-script03-01-01-2_F003.wav	01
Ses04F_script01_1_F032	 You marry that girl.  You're pronouncing him dead.  Now what happens to your father?  Do you know because I don't?	Ses04F-script01-05-01-1_F032.wav	05
Ses05M_impro04_F005	 Well, I mean, right now I'm just doing a little bit of everything.  And I don't- I don't think that I'm in like a profession, like career oriented place.	Ses05M-impro04-01-01-F005.wav	01
Ses04F_script03_1_F029	 How ridiculous.  How utterly, utterly ridiculous.	Ses04F-script03-07-01-1_F029.wav	07
Ses04F_impro03_M000	 What?  You seem so excited.	Ses04F-impro03-01-01-M000.wav	01
Ses04F_impro04_M026	 Hey, I'd love to help you but I- you don't have the kind of training that I-	Ses04F-impro04-01-01-M026.wav	01
Ses03M_impro08b_F024	 Alright Thanks.	Ses03M-impro08b-01-01-F024.wav	01
Ses01M_script03_2_M032	 Would you uh...turn that off please? You're going to wake the people upstairs.	Ses01M-script03-05-01-2_M032.wav	05
Ses03F_script02_2_F027	 No.	Ses03F-script02-04-01-2_F027.wav	04
Ses05M_script03_2_M025	 You must have let him kiss you quite a good deal more then, huh?	Ses05M-script03-05-01-2_M025.wav	05
Ses04F_impro07_F009	 The campus is beautiful. I'm so excited.	Ses04F-impro07-07-01-F009.wav	07
Ses04M_script03_1_M003	 We'll be alright, darling.  Whatever happens, aren't we?	Ses04M-script03-01-01-1_M003.wav	01
Ses04F_script03_2_M016	 Going somewhere, my dear?	Ses04F-script03-05-01-2_M016.wav	05
Ses03F_script01_2_M006	 You can't read her mind.	Ses03F-script01-01-01-2_M006.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_2_F006	 She's not Larry's girl. She knows that.	Ses03F-script01-05-01-2_F006.wav	05
Ses03M_script01_2_M017	 What do I got to hide?  Huh?  What the hell's the matter with you Kate?	Ses03M-script01-05-01-2_M017.wav	05
Ses04F_script01_2_F007	 She's not his girl, Joe.  She knows she's not.	Ses04F-script01-05-01-2_F007.wav	05
Ses03M_impro03_M011	 Ah...Anyways, so she took the ring and she goes, is this real?  So I was like, of course--	Ses03M-impro03-07-01-M011.wav	07
Ses01F_impro06_F005	 I went to see her headstone a week or two ago.	Ses01F-impro06-04-01-F005.wav	04
Ses04F_impro07_M031	 Oh, that's right. Okay, I see. Right, right, right.	Ses04F-impro07-01-01-M031.wav	01
Ses04M_script03_2_F029	 Yes, I did, quite a lot.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_F029.wav	05
Ses05M_script02_2_M016	 It was in the car, right?  When we were passing Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, Let's stop and get champagne. and I said that times a wasting or something like that, right?  You wanted it to be like it was before, right?	Ses05M-script02-01-01-2_M016.wav	01
Ses02F_impro07_M010	 [LAUGHTER]	Ses02F-impro07-07-01-M010.wav	07
Ses05M_script01_1_F005	 He cried hard?	Ses05M-script01-04-01-1_F005.wav	04
Ses05M_impro01_F003	 Yeah.  So, I can't -- I can't do anything-	Ses05M-impro01-01-01-F003.wav	01
Ses05F_impro05_M005	 It seems like it went through Heath Row.  I see it here. uh-	Ses05F-impro05-01-01-M005.wav	01
Ses03M_script02_2_F004	 Look, I'm sorry but it's still just fish to me.	Ses03M-script02-05-01-2_F004.wav	05
Ses01M_impro02_M019	 Do promise me you're going to take a lot of pictures.	Ses01M-impro02-04-01-M019.wav	04
Ses01F_script02_1_M040	 It's single mindedness with no mind.  It is urgency that is just pure urge.	Ses01F-script02-07-01-1_M040.wav	07
Ses01M_impro06_F003	 I'm sorry to hear that.	Ses01M-impro06-04-01-F003.wav	04
Ses02F_script01_3_F024	 How many?	Ses02F-script01-04-01-3_F024.wav	04
Ses03F_script01_1_M053	 No, you don't. I'm a pretty tough guy.	Ses03F-script01-01-01-1_M053.wav	01
Ses04F_impro02_F003	 I'm going to come back.  I need you to believe that.	Ses04F-impro02-04-01-F003.wav	04
Ses01F_impro05_F014	 You're kidding me, this is a joke.	Ses01F-impro05-05-01-F014.wav	05
Ses05F_impro08_F000	 Hi, sir.  How can I help you?	Ses05F-impro08-01-01-F000.wav	01
Ses05M_impro07_M011	 Finally.  I'm so excited.  We're gonna -- well, I'll be here.  We're still gonna be able to see each other.	Ses05M-impro07-07-01-M011.wav	07
Ses05F_impro04_M043	 You know I'll always help you.	Ses05F-impro04-01-01-M043.wav	01
Ses05F_impro07_M027	 Uh huh, it will be awesome.	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-M027.wav	07
Ses04M_script01_1_M041	 Then you help me stay here.	Ses04M-script01-01-01-1_M041.wav	01
Ses05M_impro04_M009	 yeah.	Ses05M-impro04-01-01-M009.wav	01
Ses03M_impro07_M019	 Thank you	Ses03M-impro07-07-01-M019.wav	07
Ses02M_script01_1_M027	 Well, if she does then that's the end of it. From her letters I think she's forgotten him.	Ses02M-script01-01-01-1_M027.wav	01
Ses01M_script03_2_M025	 Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?	Ses01M-script03-05-01-2_M025.wav	05
Ses02F_impro07_M006	 Yeah, no, definitely--It's gonna..	Ses02F-impro07-07-01-M006.wav	07
Ses04F_script03_2_M000	 As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.	Ses04F-script03-01-01-2_M000.wav	01
Ses01M_impro04_M018	 Okay. Okay no, no, no, no okay no, I need to hear this more. Come on, bring it.	Ses01M-impro04-05-01-M018.wav	05
Ses04F_script01_1_F044	 Yeah.  I can see that.	Ses04F-script01-05-01-1_F044.wav	05
Ses03F_impro06_M002	 I didn't know him, Tricia, but uh- I heard that he was a great man.	Ses03F-impro06-04-01-M002.wav	04
Ses03M_script02_2_F013	 Listen, I've waiting my entire life on this beach just standing there waiting for this fish to show up and these fish never show up.	Ses03M-script02-05-01-2_F013.wav	05
Ses03M_impro06_F007	 What happened?  What went wrong?	Ses03M-impro06-04-01-F007.wav	04
Ses01M_script01_3_M040	 I felt ashamed and I didn't want any part of it.  I guess I included you too.	Ses01M-script01-04-01-3_M040.wav	04
Ses05F_script02_2_M005	 Carla, can I ask you a question?  Now don't be upset, are you having a period?	Ses05F-script02-01-01-2_M005.wav	01
Ses03M_impro02_F013	 Do this whole thing by myself?	Ses03M-impro02-04-01-F013.wav	04
Ses04M_impro05_F007	 Um, but, actually, our policy is a fifty dollar	Ses04M-impro05-01-01-F007.wav	01
Ses02F_script02_1_M002	 I would have liked to have gone a little further up the coast to get away from the lights and the people, but I was afraid we'd miss it.	Ses02F-script02-07-01-1_M002.wav	07
Ses04F_impro07_F013	 I don't want any of those little puny ones.	Ses04F-impro07-07-01-F013.wav	07
Ses03M_script02_1_M005	 Oh, you know what I forgot?  I forgot my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I should've brought my flashlight.	Ses03M-script02-07-01-1_M005.wav	07
Ses02M_impro01_M001	 Yea. I just want to get this done,	Ses02M-impro01-01-01-M001.wav	01
Ses03M_impro04_F025	 -it's going to get better I promise you. You just got to hang in there. Everyone, I mean, you know?	Ses03M-impro04-01-01-F025.wav	01
Ses01F_script01_1_M007	 You know Larry is not coming back and I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?	Ses01F-script01-01-01-1_M007.wav	01
Ses03M_impro08b_M009	 you might have an older phone where we would use sim cards but probably not.	Ses03M-impro08b-01-01-M009.wav	01
Ses04F_impro05_F012	 I expect your airline who was responsible for my bag to give me the equivalent of the bag and all of the things in it.	Ses04F-impro05-05-01-F012.wav	05
Ses04F_script01_2_F016	 She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look, look at it.  Joe-	Ses04F-script01-05-01-2_F016.wav	05
Ses04F_impro08_M023	 Cindy, look.  If you don't get your ass a piece of paper that has a check	Ses04F-impro08-05-01-M023.wav	05
Ses05F_script03_2_F011	 Well, it seems silly to go on and on in such a thing.	Ses05F-script03-01-01-2_F011.wav	01
Ses02F_script03_2_F037	 Stop it.  Go away.  I hate you.	Ses02F-script03-05-01-2_F037.wav	05
Ses02M_script02_2_M038	 No, I know. But still, I know I don't make you happy.	Ses02M-script02-04-01-2_M038.wav	04
Ses02F_script03_2_F014	 What?	Ses02F-script03-05-01-2_F014.wav	05
Ses04F_script01_1_F024	 Now you can go on from there and you know where to go, but I'm telling you I don't know where to go.  See I don't know.  Now what can I do for you?	Ses04F-script01-05-01-1_F024.wav	05
Ses02M_impro05_F005	 Well, sometimes it's just late baggage or misplaced baggage and it comes out but it seems to be here and just I'm reading off of this that	Ses02M-impro05-01-01-F005.wav	01
Ses02M_script01_1_F025	 How do you know she'll marry you? Maybe she feels the same way your father does.	Ses02M-script01-01-01-1_F025.wav	01
Ses04F_script02_2_F007	 For heaven's sake, this is not about fish.	Ses04F-script02-05-01-2_F007.wav	05
Ses02F_script01_3_M031	 Then I came back and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them seemed like sort of a bus accident.  I went to work with Dad and that rat race again.	Ses02F-script01-04-01-3_M031.wav	04
Ses05M_script01_3_F024	 Do you still feel like that?	Ses05M-script01-04-01-3_F024.wav	04
Ses03M_script03_2_F004	 Just a little perhaps but nothing serious.	Ses03M-script03-01-01-2_F004.wav	01
Ses05M_script03_2_F039	 This is the end! Do you understand me? This is the end.	Ses05M-script03-05-01-2_F039.wav	05
Ses04F_impro08_F009	 Okay.  Um, I'm going to go ahead and transfer you over to another department.  They'll need your address.	Ses04F-impro08-01-01-F009.wav	01
Ses01F_impro07_M003	 Oh-Yeah, I bet you're really excited. Oh.  That's what loans are for?  Right? Exactly.	Ses01F-impro07-07-01-M003.wav	07
Ses01M_script01_1_M040	 Then help me stay.	Ses01M-script01-04-01-1_M040.wav	04
Ses04M_impro04_F015	 I think maybe you can't get employed because you aren't willing to take responsibility for your own actions.	Ses04M-impro04-01-01-F015.wav	01
Ses03M_script03_2_M011	 No particular reason.  Anyhow they were very small ones.	Ses03M-script03-05-01-2_M011.wav	05
Ses04F_impro07_F027	 Everything worked out perfectly.	Ses04F-impro07-07-01-F027.wav	07
Ses01M_impro05_F030	 I wish I could give it to you.	Ses01M-impro05-01-01-F030.wav	01
Ses01M_impro01_F019	 Don't raise your voice with me.	Ses01M-impro01-05-01-F019.wav	05
Ses02M_script02_1_F016	 I'm just not.	Ses02M-script02-04-01-1_F016.wav	04
Ses01F_impro02_M013	 I just don't know how I'm going to do it without you.	Ses01F-impro02-04-01-M013.wav	04
Ses04M_script02_1_M005	 Whose is it?	Ses04M-script02-01-01-1_M005.wav	01
Ses05F_impro07_M015	 You're going to have so much fun.  And there's lo- tons of people, you're going to meet so many people, I'm going to meet so many people too, because we're going to be there together.	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-M015.wav	07
Ses03M_impro05a_M016	 Oh, oh, that's a good deduction.	Ses03M-impro05a-05-01-M016.wav	05
Ses03F_script02_2_F036	 Things have never turned out anything the way that I thought they would be.	Ses03F-script02-04-01-2_F036.wav	04
Ses04M_script02_2_F007	 We just have different ideas about what this evening is supposed to look like.	Ses04M-script02-05-01-2_F007.wav	05

Ses01F_impro02_M009	 I just don't see why it has to be you.	Ses01F-impro02-04-01-M009.wav	04

Ses01M_script01_1_F029	 I don't see why it has to be Annie.	Ses01M-script01-05-01-1_F029.wav	05
Ses01F_script01_1_M004	 I guess he is.	Ses01F-script01-01-01-1_M004.wav	01
Ses05F_script02_1_M021	 This is a big night for these guys.  Life's last orgy. Yeah	Ses05F-script02-07-01-1_M021.wav	07

Ses01F_script02_2_M019	 It's when we were driving past that Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, let's get some champagne.  I said no, time's a wasting or something like that.	Ses01F-script02-01-01-2_M019.wav	01

Ses03F_script01_3_F030	 How many?	Ses03F-script01-04-01-3_F030.wav	04
Ses01F_impro04_F013	 I just- I mean I call people up and I tell them what I'm good at.	Ses01F-impro04-01-01-F013.wav	01
Ses05F_impro07_M003	 So you're not going to leave me.	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-M003.wav	07
Ses04F_impro06_M006	 you know, you don't- you know, how long do you want the person to go through that, you know.	Ses04F-impro06-01-01-M006.wav	01
Ses03F_script02_1_M036	 I wouldn't miss this for anything. I mean, think about this. Okay, I know you're not interested, but just think about this for a minute.	Ses03F-script02-07-01-1_M036.wav	07
Ses04F_impro02_F009	 And now- and now it's really shitty timing but now I have to go.	Ses04F-impro02-04-01-F009.wav	04
Ses03F_script03_2_F040	 This is the end. Do you hear? The end. Now and forever.	Ses03F-script03-05-01-2_F040.wav	05
Ses04M_script02_2_F029	 But this isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.	Ses04M-script02-05-01-2_F029.wav	05

Ses05F_impro06_M005	 Absolutely, absolutely.	Ses05F-impro06-04-01-M005.wav	04
Ses01M_script03_2_F040	 This is the end do you hear me?  Finally and forever.	Ses01M-script03-05-01-2_F040.wav	05
Ses05M_script01_1b_M032	 But if that can't happen then I'll just get out.	Ses05M-script01-05-01-1b_M032.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_1_M010	 Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing, love?	Ses04M-script03-01-01-1_M010.wav	01
Ses05F_impro03_F043	 I am very excited	Ses05F-impro03-07-01-F043.wav	07

Ses05F_script03_2_M019	 It's a pity you didn't take a little more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.	Ses05F-script03-05-01-2_M019.wav	05
Ses03M_script01_1_M007	 I don't know.  But I know one thing mom, we made a terrible mistake with dad.	Ses03M-script01-04-01-1_M007.wav	04

Ses02F_impro06_M002	 I'm sorry to hear about that.	Ses02F-impro06-01-01-M002.wav	01
Ses01F_script01_3_M032	 To bring that on to the earth again, you know, is like some kind of monument and I thought I would just make a difference to them.	Ses01F-script01-04-01-3_M032.wav	04
Ses02M_impro02_F004	 It's dangerous; I mean how can you make sure that you'll	Ses02M-impro02-04-01-F004.wav	04

Ses02F_impro04_F016	 I just wanna crawl in a hole, you know.  Like it just makes you not wanna even open your eyes in the morning.	Ses02F-impro04-04-01-F016.wav	04
Ses04F_impro07_M032	 A party celebrating your acceptance.	Ses04F-impro07-01-01-M032.wav	01
Ses01M_script03_2_F033	 They are away in Tunis.	Ses01M-script03-05-01-2_F033.wav	05
Ses01M_impro04_F005	 Did you ever think it might be your attitude that's...	Ses01M-impro04-01-01-F005.wav	01
Ses03M_script03_1_F003	 Now and always sweet.	Ses03M-script03-07-01-1_F003.wav	07
Ses03F_impro06_M003	 yeah.	Ses03F-impro06-01-01-M003.wav	01
Ses03M_script03_2_M030	 Okay, like I mentioned before I had three very small, minute liquor glasses of brandy.  That's not even enough to get a child of two drunk.	Ses03M-script03-05-01-2_M030.wav	05
Ses04F_script02_2_F031	 No.	Ses04F-script02-05-01-2_F031.wav	05
Ses02F_impro07_F011	 And you know what, you know what I mean, like it's recognizable rather than just being like I went some random school. It's like people really know what you...	Ses02F-impro07-07-01-F011.wav	07
Ses03M_impro03_M013	 Come on. It was her birthday.	Ses03M-impro03-07-01-M013.wav	07
Ses03F_impro06_F015	 I know. He was, he had so much going for him.	Ses03F-impro06-04-01-F015.wav	04
Ses05F_script02_1_M011	 [LAUGHTER] I wonder if they can hear me talk or if they can feel the vibration in the sand when we are moving around	Ses05F-script02-07-01-1_M011.wav	07
Ses01F_impro06_F028	 I remember, too, when we were--  she died at U.C.L.A.  She had brain surgery and there was not much hope to begin with, but I gave blood for her surgery, her mom and I before, so we dropped her off in the waiting room and then we were giving blood and came back.  And she, in her wheelchair, like can hardly do anything, reciting her poetry for these people like in the waiting room.  All she needs is a God damn audience.  You know?	Ses01F-impro06-04-01-F028.wav	04
Ses05M_impro07_M002	 Yes! I just found out today.  I just got the letter.	Ses05M-impro07-07-01-M002.wav	07

Ses05F_script02_1_F016	 Yes.	Ses05F-script02-01-01-1_F016.wav	01
Ses03M_impro08a_M006	 Um- I think part of it has to do with the network being down.  It's been having some trouble the last few weeks--	Ses03M-impro08a-01-01-M006.wav	01
Ses03F_impro05_F005	 Wait, sir. You're- You're completely not--what do you mean, stole it? How can they just steal it from an airplane? It was up in the air?	Ses03F-impro05-05-01-F005.wav	05
Ses02M_script01_3_M030	 I got this idea watching 'em go down.  Everything was being destroyed, see, but it seemed that one new thing was made.  A sort of responsibility.  Man for man. You know what I mean?	Ses02M-script01-04-01-3_M030.wav	04
Ses01F_script03_2_F027	 Oh shut up.	Ses01F-script03-05-01-2_F027.wav	05
Ses05M_impro05_M006	 Well, I would hope so.	Ses05M-impro05-01-01-M006.wav	01
Ses02M_impro08_M005	 I know they don't tell you that kind of thing.	Ses02M-impro08-01-01-M005.wav	01
Ses02F_impro02_F007	 and--I mean, my daughter--I don't want to put her in danger.  You know?  She has to stay.	Ses02F-impro02-04-01-F007.wav	04
Ses02F_script02_1_M001	 This is great, isn't it?  Look at the night we've got here, couldn't be better.	Ses02F-script02-07-01-1_M001.wav	07
Ses05F_script01_3_F021	 yeah sure.	Ses05F-script01-01-01-3_F021.wav	01
Ses05F_impro03_M012	 Thanks a lot.  Well, okay, you've got to tell me the details.  What did he say?  Where was it?  What happened?	Ses05F-impro03-07-01-M012.wav	07
Ses03F_script01_1_M000	 He saw it.	Ses03F-script01-01-01-1_M000.wav	01
Ses05M_script03_1_M026	 The one where you bought that little painted wooden stake and you put it on my bed.	Ses05M-script03-07-01-1_M026.wav	07
Ses03M_impro05a_F009	 Eight pieces of luggage.  Okay.	Ses03M-impro05a-01-01-F009.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_1_F014	 They do come back.	Ses03F-script01-01-01-1_F014.wav	01
Ses01F_impro04_M004	 I'm just saying I have a friend that got a good job on it so I was just recommending it.	Ses01F-impro04-01-01-M004.wav	01
Ses04M_impro06_M013	 there should just be some sort of rule that people don't die until they're older, 'cause then, at least, it's expected.	Ses04M-impro06-04-01-M013.wav	04
Ses02M_script01_1_F033	 What the hell is this, are you crazy?	Ses02M-script01-05-01-1_F033.wav	05
Ses04F_script03_2_F030	 Why?	Ses04F-script03-05-01-2_F030.wav	05
Ses02F_script03_2_F041	 Oh Yes, I am.	Ses02F-script03-05-01-2_F041.wav	05
Ses01M_impro03_F006	 That's so cool. Uh huh.	Ses01M-impro03-07-01-F006.wav	07
Ses05F_script02_1_M014	 Right.	Ses05F-script02-07-01-1_M014.wav	07
Ses04M_script01_1_F033	 Just give it some more thought.	Ses04M-script01-01-01-1_F033.wav	01
Ses02M_impro07_M018	 What?	Ses02M-impro07-07-01-M018.wav	07
Ses03M_impro05a_F024	 Yes.  Well, because--	Ses03M-impro05a-01-01-F024.wav	01

Ses04F_impro03_M034	 Fried chicken, mashed potatoes.	Ses04F-impro03-01-01-M034.wav	01
Ses01F_script01_2_F011	 I won't stand for any nonsense.	Ses01F-script01-05-01-2_F011.wav	05
Ses03F_script02_2_F018	 You brought a bottle of champagne.	Ses03F-script02-04-01-2_F018.wav	04
Ses02M_script03_1_M012	 You mustn't be serious my dear one, that's just what they want.	Ses02M-script03-07-01-1_M012.wav	07
Ses01M_impro02_M018	 We're going to be okay.	Ses01M-impro02-04-01-M018.wav	04
Ses03M_impro01_M023	 No.  I'm not going anywhere.  I'm staying here-- I am filling out right now okay just calm down. I'm filling out right now-- Just take the god damn piece of paper.	Ses03M-impro01-05-01-M023.wav	05

Ses04M_script01_1_F035	 Are you crazy?	Ses04M-script01-05-01-1_F035.wav	05
Ses05F_impro08_F019	 Yeah, we- Somebody went in and- and cleared the problem and it looks like you're all paid.	Ses05F-impro08-01-01-F019.wav	01
Ses04M_impro03_M002	 Yeah, it's pretty amazing, huh?	Ses04M-impro03-07-01-M002.wav	07
Ses03F_script01_1_M030	 Well then I guess it's over then. But from her letters I think she's forgotten him.	Ses03F-script01-01-01-1_M030.wav	01
Ses05F_script01_1_F026	 Well how did you know that she will go along with it, I mean maybe she feels the same way as your father?	Ses05F-script01-01-01-1_F026.wav	01
Ses05F_impro02_F031	 I'm going to miss their first words.	Ses05F-impro02-04-01-F031.wav	04
Ses04F_script02_2_F023	 Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne from the bottle.	Ses04F-script02-04-01-2_F023.wav	04
Ses04M_script02_1_F003	 It's ours.  It's mine, too.	Ses04M-script02-05-01-1_F003.wav	05
Ses05M_impro03_F007	 Oh, my God.  That's so dramatic.	Ses05M-impro03-07-01-F007.wav	07
Ses05M_impro07_F029	 Um- I think I have some friends.	Ses05M-impro07-01-01-F029.wav	01
Ses05F_impro01_F017	 Isn't there anything you can do?  Just call over and ask them if I can go to the front of the line in the other line.	Ses05F-impro01-05-01-F017.wav	05
Ses02F_script02_1_M025	 Yeah, but that moment on the beach, is the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping is laying eggs or what do you--spawning or mating.  I mean,	Ses02F-script02-07-01-1_M025.wav	07
Ses02M_impro08_M021	 so it is a little a little hard in that situation if you want -- you know you can -um- we can- we can issue another credit card.	Ses02M-impro08-01-01-M021.wav	01
Ses02F_impro08_M008	 Okay. So--	Ses02F-impro08-01-01-M008.wav	01

Ses03M_impro02_F014	 Carry her for nine months and then yes.	Ses03M-impro02-04-01-F014.wav	04
Ses05F_script03_1_M011	 What does it all mean?  That's what I asked myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean?	Ses05F-script03-07-01-1_M011.wav	07
Ses04F_impro03_F013	 Thanks. Thanks a lot.  You're really helping the Excitement here. I hope no one dies.	Ses04F-impro03-07-01-F013.wav	07

Ses02F_impro04_M018	 I mean, it's just, it's really--I don't know, yeah, it's about their opinions and it's about, I don't know, just getting yourself out there and--	Ses02F-impro04-01-01-M018.wav	01

Ses04F_impro03_F040	 Ha ha ha.	Ses04F-impro03-07-01-F040.wav	07
Ses03M_impro03_F023	 Wait, wait, wait I want you to marry me?  No, shouldn't you like be more like a question like, would you marry me?  Not like I want you to marry me.  It's like a demand.	Ses03M-impro03-07-01-F023.wav	07
Ses01M_impro05_M007	 You people have just been tossing me around like a used hanky.	Ses01M-impro05-05-01-M007.wav	05
Ses04F_impro03_M042	 has just rushed to my head, and I, and I mean honestly.	Ses04F-impro03-07-01-M042.wav	07

Ses04M_impro07_M029	 I'll go to basketball games.	Ses04M-impro07-01-01-M029.wav	01
Ses01F_script03_2_F016	 Oh.  It's a woman's duty to allure the man.	Ses01F-script03-05-01-2_F016.wav	05
Ses04M_script01_2_F009	 Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men.  Why hasn't she married?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she's waited.	Ses04M-script01-05-01-2_F009.wav	05
Ses02M_script01_1_F026	 Trouble is you don't see enough women, you never did.	Ses02M-script01-05-01-1_F026.wav	05
Ses04M_script01_3_M033	 because nobody was changed.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive;	Ses04M-script01-04-01-3_M033.wav	04
Ses02M_impro03_M026	 I know.	Ses02M-impro03-07-01-M026.wav	07
Ses03F_impro03_F004	 at the end of the performance, you know, like we're all clapping and stuff. And all of a sudden I look over and	Ses03F-impro03-07-01-F004.wav	07
Ses03M_script01_1_F000	 What's he going to say?  Maybe we ought to talk to him before he sees it.	Ses03M-script01-01-01-1_F000.wav	01
Ses05F_script02_2_M003	 I am not the only one, look at all these people.	Ses05F-script02-01-01-2_M003.wav	01
Ses02F_impro05_M009	 Yes, I know. I know-. It's It's frustrating.  Unfortunately though-- um	Ses02F-impro05-01-01-M009.wav	01
Ses01F_impro03_M006	 He turned to you and was like...	Ses01F-impro03-01-01-M006.wav	01
Ses04M_impro08_M006	 I am seeing the two hundred dollar charge.	Ses04M-impro08-01-01-M006.wav	01
Ses01M_script01_3_M024	 It's kind of all mixed up with all these other things.	Ses01M-script01-04-01-3_M024.wav	04
Ses02F_script01_3_M034	 Because otherwise all you have is really loot and there's blood on it.  And I didn't want to take any of it.  And I guess that included you.	Ses02F-script01-04-01-3_M034.wav	04
Ses01F_script02_2_M021	 Sure.  All right.  Okay.	Ses01F-script02-01-01-2_M021.wav	01
Ses04F_impro07_M046	 I can see it in your eyes.  You want to go.	Ses04F-impro07-07-01-M046.wav	07
Ses04M_impro06_F016	 Seems like if the whole world's sad, then it's okay for you to be.	Ses04M-impro06-04-01-F016.wav	04
Ses05M_script02_1_M006	 How could we have forgotten it? Well, I hope the moon stays out.  I wonder, do they always run during a full moon?  I can't remember, was the moon full last year, do you remember?	Ses05M-script02-07-01-1_M006.wav	07
Ses02F_script03_2_F012	 Well, it's become a habit with you.	Ses02F-script03-01-01-2_F012.wav	01
Ses01M_script01_2_M007	 And how do you know why she's waited.	Ses01M-script01-01-01-2_M007.wav	01
Ses04M_impro06_M002	 a major part of your life and then they're gone.  And I don't know.  That's not really -- it's never really happened to me before.	Ses04M-impro06-04-01-M002.wav	04
Ses04M_impro04_F002	 Have you gone, like, signed up with a temp agency?  Maybe they can help.	Ses04M-impro04-01-01-F002.wav	01

Ses02F_script02_2_M036	 I'm doing the best I can.	Ses02F-script02-04-01-2_M036.wav	04
Ses04F_script02_2_F026	 No.	Ses04F-script02-04-01-2_F026.wav	04
Ses03M_impro02_M025	 They want me there two years but I could probably get	Ses03M-impro02-04-01-M025.wav	04
Ses03M_impro04_F031	 Sixteen hundred.	Ses03M-impro04-01-01-F031.wav	01
Ses03F_impro07_F021	 Awesome. We're both going to be in L.A.	Ses03F-impro07-07-01-F021.wav	07
Ses05M_script01_1_M023	 She is not Larry's girl!	Ses05M-script01-05-01-1_M023.wav	05
Ses02F_script02_2_M000	 Well, so what do you think?	Ses02F-script02-07-01-2_M000.wav	07
Ses03M_script01_3_F033	 that includes me too, I mean and the money, you have right to that money.  Your father put planes up in the air, good planes and he deserves it, you should be proud of that.  A man should be paid for that.	Ses03M-script01-04-01-3_F033.wav	04
Ses03M_script01_1_F028	 Did you ask Annie yet?	Ses03M-script01-01-01-1_F028.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_2_M001	 Well, maybe, maybe he just wanted to see her.	Ses03F-script01-01-01-2_M001.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_1_M016	 You know-you know why I asked Annie here, right?	Ses03F-script01-01-01-1_M016.wav	01
Ses01M_script01_2_F009	 I want you to---act like he is coming back.  Don't think I haven't noticed you, both of you since Chris invited her here.  I won't stand for any nonsense.	Ses01M-script01-05-01-2_F009.wav	05
Ses05M_script02_2_F014	 And I remember thinking to myself, finally.  I am as happy as I am supposed to be.	Ses05M-script02-04-01-2_F014.wav	04
Ses01M_impro06_M010	 Just like it.	Ses01M-impro06-04-01-M010.wav	04
Ses01M_script01_1_F030	 That's a good answer but it doesn't answer anything.  You haven't seen her since you went away to war, it's been five years.	Ses01M-script01-05-01-1_F030.wav	05
Ses03F_impro08_F009	 Okay, well, if you would like, um- we will be turning on the systems in probably about ten hours.	Ses03F-impro08-01-01-F009.wav	01
Ses02F_script01_2_M002	 What do you mean?  He lived next door to the girl all his life.  Why wouldn't he want to see her again?	Ses02F-script01-01-01-2_M002.wav	01
Ses01M_impro02_M002	 I just got a letter I have to go back.	Ses01M-impro02-04-01-M002.wav	04

Ses03M_impro02_M001	 Hey.	Ses03M-impro02-04-01-M001.wav	04
Ses05F_impro04_F045	 I will, I will.	Ses05F-impro04-01-01-F045.wav	01
Ses05F_script03_2_F010	 I don't see why you want any.  You've already had three glasses.	Ses05F-script03-01-01-2_F010.wav	01
Ses04M_script01_1_M038	 Yes.  I like getting an hour a day.  If I have to grub for money all day long, at least at evening, I want it beautiful.	Ses04M-script01-05-01-1_M038.wav	05
Ses01F_impro04_M013	 It's kind of helpful when getting a job.	Ses01F-impro04-01-01-M013.wav	01
Ses05M_impro04_F035	 Well, um, is that kinda like the side of you that you let people see when you go into these job interviews?	Ses05M-impro04-01-01-F035.wav	01
Ses01F_script02_1_M032	 And last year, I remember distinctly you said, you were so excited to get here that you don't remember you stubbed your toe until we were in the car.	Ses01F-script02-01-01-1_M032.wav	01
Ses02M_impro04_F001	 You've been doing a lot of work for it, right?	Ses02M-impro04-01-01-F001.wav	01
Ses05M_script01_1_M025	 To hell with that!	Ses05M-script01-05-01-1_M025.wav	05
Ses01M_impro05_M006	 I've been sitting here for four hours.	Ses01M-impro05-05-01-M006.wav	05
Ses01M_script01_1_M021	 She is not Larry's girl.	Ses01M-script01-05-01-1_M021.wav	05
Ses01M_script01_3_M021	 No, no, it's nothing like that.	Ses01M-script01-04-01-3_M021.wav	04
Ses04F_script01_1_M016	 You know why.	Ses04F-script01-01-01-1_M016.wav	01
Ses05M_script03_2_F017	 No, it isn't.	Ses05M-script03-05-01-2_F017.wav	05
Ses03M_impro08a_M008	 No.  Okay.  We're not charging you for any of these months.  We're going to give you three months free.	Ses03M-impro08a-01-01-M008.wav	01

Ses01F_script02_1_M035	 Look there, see?  What's that?  No, that's - that's just seaweed.	Ses01F-script02-07-01-1_M035.wav	07
Ses02F_script03_1_F016	 Oh, dear, shall we like that?	Ses02F-script03-01-01-1_F016.wav	01
Ses04F_impro08_M015	 and if I get sent to another operator, I'll have to tell them the same damn story again.  I don't- I think I'm just going to lose my mind.  So if you could please just not do that, that would be great.  Thank you.	Ses04F-impro08-05-01-M015.wav	05
Ses03F_script01_1_F021	 Well, that's only your business, Chris.	Ses03F-script01-01-01-1_F021.wav	01
Ses04F_script01_3_M044	 Otherwise what you have is really just loot and there's blood on it.  I didn't want to take any of it.	Ses04F-script01-04-01-3_M044.wav	04
Ses02F_impro07_F013	 Like it has some prestige. so	Ses02F-impro07-07-01-F013.wav	07
Ses02M_script03_1_M009	 Oh darling don't say that.	Ses02M-script03-04-01-1_M009.wav	04
Ses03M_impro05b_M025	 This is the worst customer service I've ever gotten before.	Ses03M-impro05b-05-01-M025.wav	05
Ses01M_script02_2_F031	 This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.	Ses01M-script02-05-01-2_F031.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_F035	 Not very funny, dear.  You'd better have some more brandy.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_F035.wav	05
Ses01M_script01_1_M002	 I was out here at four this morning I heard a crack and I looked out the window and he was standing right over there.	Ses01M-script01-01-01-1_M002.wav	01
Ses05F_impro02_F036	 Yeah.	Ses05F-impro02-04-01-F036.wav	04
Ses05M_impro04_F014	 Right.  Maybe you have, like, you know a little bit of an abrasive vibe or something.	Ses05M-impro04-01-01-F014.wav	01
Ses05F_script01_3_M024	 Remember when I was overseas?  I was in command of the company.	Ses05F-script01-04-01-3_M024.wav	04
Ses02M_impro05_F006	 Uh- it didn't make it into the second plane so it looks like there - they don't actually know what happened to it.	Ses02M-impro05-01-01-F006.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_3_M034	 I mean, that's-that's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had. They didn't just die. They killed themselves for each other. And I mean that exactly. A little more selfish and they'd still be here today.	Ses03F-script01-04-01-3_M034.wav	04
Ses04F_impro03_M027	 Okay.  Fine.  So green and what?	Ses04F-impro03-01-01-M027.wav	01
Ses04F_impro07_M020	 Hey, that's cool.	Ses04F-impro07-01-01-M020.wav	01

Ses04F_script01_2_F001	 It's been three years.  Why all of a sudden?	Ses04F-script01-05-01-2_F001.wav	05
Ses01F_script03_2_F005	 Well, what of it?	Ses01F-script03-01-01-2_F005.wav	01
Ses04F_impro03_F050	 You could make her that excited.  You really like her.  You guys have been together for a really long time now.	Ses04F-impro03-07-01-F050.wav	07
Ses03F_script03_2_M026	 did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?	Ses03F-script03-05-01-2_M026.wav	05
Ses03F_impro05_F008	 Not to mention I have my work in there.	Ses03F-impro05-05-01-F008.wav	05
Ses01M_script01_3_M028	 Takes awhile to toss something like that off.  I mean they weren't just men, you know.	Ses01M-script01-04-01-3_M028.wav	04
Ses05F_impro02_M029	 I understand.  I'm worried about you.  I don't know what's going to happen to you.	Ses05F-impro02-04-01-M029.wav	04
Ses05M_impro07_M019	 I don't- you know ,I feel the same way, you know what I mean.  And everybody says a lot of other crap you know, they don't know what they are talking about anyway.	Ses05M-impro07-07-01-M019.wav	07
Ses01F_script02_2_F001	 About what?	Ses01F-script02-01-01-2_F001.wav	01
Ses03F_impro06_F014	 Kind of a whole year. I mean, he suffered with this, this monster, this thing, this disease.	Ses03F-impro06-04-01-F014.wav	04
Ses04M_script03_2_M022	 Going out somewhere, my dear?	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M022.wav	05
Ses03F_script01_2_M011	 All right. All right. Calm yourself.	Ses03F-script01-05-01-2_M011.wav	05
Ses05M_impro02_M030	 You you record every second.  You record every second because I want to see it all.  Okay?	Ses05M-impro02-07-01-M030.wav	07
Ses01M_script01_1_F031	 He thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl you're pronouncing him dead.	Ses01M-script01-04-01-1_F031.wav	04
Ses01M_impro06_M000	 Yeah, I'm just-- yeah	Ses01M-impro06-04-01-M000.wav	04

Ses03M_script01_1_M005	 I could hear it right through the floor.	Ses03M-script01-04-01-1_M005.wav	04
Ses03F_script03_1_M011	 [LAUGHTER]. You mustn't be serious, my dear one, that's what they want.	Ses03F-script03-07-01-1_M011.wav	07
Ses04F_impro03_F041	 Ha ha.	Ses04F-impro03-07-01-F041.wav	07
Ses05F_impro05_F005	 Yeah.	Ses05F-impro05-01-01-F005.wav	01
Ses04F_impro07_M037	 I don't know I just thought that, you know, maybe we could, you know, I don't know.  It's like, you know, just test the waters anyway.  I don't see what the problem is.	Ses04F-impro07-07-01-M037.wav	07
Ses01F_impro03_M003	 Who did you marry?	Ses01F-impro03-07-01-M003.wav	07
Ses05F_impro07_F001	 I got into college.	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-F001.wav	07

Ses01M_script01_3_M037	 Driving my new car and I felt guilty you know opening my bank book seeing a new refrigerator.	Ses01M-script01-04-01-3_M037.wav	04
Ses02F_impro07_M029	 A U.S.C. graduate now. You're set.	Ses02F-impro07-07-01-M029.wav	07
Ses01M_impro05_M022	 My computer which has all of my data which I'm collecting right now.	Ses01M-impro05-05-01-M022.wav	05
Ses02F_script01_2_M018	 What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you Kate?	Ses02F-script01-05-01-2_M018.wav	05
Ses03F_script02_1_M009	 We should have brought our flashlight. I can't believe we forgot to bring it.	Ses03F-script02-07-01-1_M009.wav	07
Ses01M_impro05_F003	 Georgia?	Ses01M-impro05-01-01-F003.wav	01
Ses04M_script02_1_M021	 Oh, it's a big night for these guys.  Uh, life's last orgy.	Ses04M-script02-07-01-1_M021.wav	07
Ses04F_impro07_M034	 Well, that's really cool that you're going to be staying in the same city and everything. so umm	Ses04F-impro07-07-01-M034.wav	07

Ses01M_impro05_F024	 We've actually...	Ses01M-impro05-01-01-F024.wav	01
Ses05F_impro02_F011	 Iraq.	Ses05F-impro02-04-01-F011.wav	04
Ses02M_impro04_F004	 Well, but you care about what you do, right?	Ses02M-impro04-01-01-F004.wav	01
Ses01M_impro07_M009	 Where should I move?	Ses01M-impro07-07-01-M009.wav	07
Ses03M_impro05a_M005	 Yes.	Ses03M-impro05a-05-01-M005.wav	05
Ses03F_impro08_F024	 Well, ten hours worth of minutes--	Ses03F-impro08-01-01-F024.wav	01
Ses05M_script01_1_M004	 No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone.	Ses05M-script01-04-01-1_M004.wav	04
Ses02M_script01_3_M022	 Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going from me.	Ses02M-script01-04-01-3_M022.wav	04

Ses01F_script01_1_M002	 Four o clock this morning.  I heard a crack and I woke up and looked out.  He was standing right over there when it cracked.	Ses01F-script01-01-01-1_M002.wav	01
Ses03M_impro08a_F013	 You sign the contract and then down the line the phone doesn't work and you're stuck, you can't go to a new...no.  No contracts for me.  You give me a new phone.	Ses03M-impro08a-05-01-F013.wav	05
Ses01F_script01_3_F014	 Chris, I've been ready a long, long, time.	Ses01F-script01-01-01-3_F014.wav	01
Ses04F_impro07_F015	 U.S.C. has a major in that, right.	Ses04F-impro07-07-01-F015.wav	07
Ses01F_script03_1_M024	 Let's be superficial, and just pity those poor philosophers, huh?  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party for as long as we can, you know, like small, idiotic school children.	Ses01F-script03-07-01-1_M024.wav	07
Ses01F_script01_1_M034	 I'll get out.  I'll get married and I'll move somewhere else, maybe New York.	Ses01F-script01-01-01-1_M034.wav	01
Ses02M_script02_2_M021	 Yea. Okay, sure, no. I see. Listen, you want to dance?	Ses02M-script02-01-01-2_M021.wav	01
Ses03M_impro04_M038	 Same difference.	Ses03M-impro04-01-01-M038.wav	01
Ses05M_script01_1_M037	 Well, you help me stay here.	Ses05M-script01-05-01-1_M037.wav	05
Ses02M_script02_1_F017	 Yes.	Ses02M-script02-01-01-1_F017.wav	01
Ses04M_script03_1_M007	 With the mo- with the most perfect poise?	Ses04M-script03-07-01-1_M007.wav	07
Ses01M_script01_3_F003	 Not sorry, no.  I can't stay here.	Ses01M-script01-04-01-3_F003.wav	04
Ses03F_impro02_F007	 Well umm- actually they--I was promoted.	Ses03F-impro02-07-01-F007.wav	07
Ses04F_impro06_M008	 Yeah.	Ses04F-impro06-04-01-M008.wav	04
Ses05F_impro07_M016	 Sure, why not.  I don't know why not, I'm not doing anything I have no plans, I could live anywhere I want.	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-M016.wav	07
Ses01M_script01_3_M016	 why didn't you let me know?	Ses01M-script01-07-01-3_M016.wav	07
Ses05M_script03_2_F036	 Go away!  Go away!  I- I hate you.	Ses05M-script03-05-01-2_F036.wav	05
Ses04F_impro08_M016	 You don't understand because you've never gone to Del Taco and gotten the service that I've gotten.  You don't understand.	Ses04F-impro08-05-01-M016.wav	05
Ses03F_impro06_F024	 He was my brother.	Ses03F-impro06-04-01-F024.wav	04
Ses04M_script01_2_F010	 Because she knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my worst moments, I think of her waiting and I know, again, that I'm right.	Ses04M-script01-05-01-2_F010.wav	05
Ses02M_impro03_F024	 Golly, it just makes me all like romantic inside, like I really want that to happen to me. [LAUGHTER]	Ses02M-impro03-07-01-F024.wav	07
Ses01M_script03_1_F031	 Oh, Charles.  That was his name Charles. He did wriggle so beautifully.	Ses01M-script03-07-01-1_F031.wav	07
Ses02M_impro01_F002	 do you have two forms of ID with you?	Ses02M-impro01-01-01-F002.wav	01
Ses01M_script02_1_F022	 Last year, you'll also remember we got--our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat, we got into a big fight and we did not see the grunions.	Ses01M-script02-05-01-1_F022.wav	05
Ses05F_script03_2_F022	 Yes, I did quite a bit.	Ses05F-script03-01-01-2_F022.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_3_F008	 Well, you've been embarrassed ever since I came.	Ses03F-script01-04-01-3_F008.wav	04
Ses04M_impro08_F030	 You too.	Ses04M-impro08-01-01-F030.wav	01
Ses02M_script01_1_F034	 What about the business? What is this?	Ses02M-script01-05-01-1_F034.wav	05
Ses01F_impro05_M029	 Well then maybe you can just call him and he can give you more money.  But right now all I can do--	Ses01F-impro05-01-01-M029.wav	01
Ses05F_impro02_M004	 You got called up.	Ses05F-impro02-05-01-M004.wav	05

Ses04M_impro03_F012	 Well I don't know.  Throwing it out there.	Ses04M-impro03-07-01-F012.wav	07
Ses03M_impro05a_F021	 Please, please	Ses03M-impro05a-01-01-F021.wav	01
Ses03M_impro05b_F013	 We can do Holiday Inn or...?	Ses03M-impro05b-01-01-F013.wav	01
Ses02F_script02_2_M029	 Well, welcome to the human race.  Do you think this is what I had in mind when I proposed?  That four years down the road, we'd be at the beach yelling at each other over fish?	Ses02F-script02-05-01-2_M029.wav	05
Ses02F_impro01_M001	 Okay.  Let me see here.  Um, we need--we need your original birth certificate.	Ses02F-impro01-01-01-M001.wav	01
Ses04F_script02_2_M040	 Maybe if you were with somebody else too.	Ses04F-script02-04-01-2_M040.wav	04
Ses03M_impro06_M002	 Yeah.	Ses03M-impro06-04-01-M002.wav	04
Ses04F_script03_1_M031	 The worst one was in Cannes when your curling irons burnt holes in my dressing gown.	Ses04F-script03-01-01-1_M031.wav	01
Ses05M_impro07_F028	 All dudes?	Ses05M-impro07-01-01-F028.wav	01
Ses05M_impro03_F015	 Okay Okay.	Ses05M-impro03-07-01-F015.wav	07
Ses05M_impro05_M003	 And so I waited there, but nothing came.	Ses05M-impro05-01-01-M003.wav	01
Ses02F_script03_1_M001	 I wonder.	Ses02F-script03-01-01-1_M001.wav	01
Ses05F_impro07_M012	 it is going to be so much fun. Yes.	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-M012.wav	07
Ses04M_script03_1_F007	 Certainly.  I shall probably do a court curtsey.	Ses04M-script03-07-01-1_F007.wav	07
Ses02F_impro07_M003	 Are you gonna go? you gonna-	Ses02F-impro07-07-01-M003.wav	07
Ses04F_script02_1_M039	 where we stand for massive celebration of sex and death.	Ses04F-script02-07-01-1_M039.wav	07
Ses04M_impro05_M026	 but I need to speak to somebody who can make the three check thing happen.	Ses04M-impro05-05-01-M026.wav	05
Ses03M_impro08a_M026	 Sara Brown.	Ses03M-impro08a-01-01-M026.wav	01
Ses04M_impro07_F004	 That's amazing.  I've seen it on TV. Um, Wow.  I mean, well what are you going to major in?  What are you going to do?	Ses04M-impro07-07-01-F004.wav	07
Ses03M_impro05b_M016	 Soon as you...that's not good enough okay?	Ses03M-impro05b-05-01-M016.wav	05
Ses02M_script01_1_M035	 If I can't do that here well, then I'll have to get out.	Ses02M-script01-04-01-1_M035.wav	04
Ses01F_impro03_F019	 Yeah.	Ses01F-impro03-01-01-F019.wav	01
Ses02F_impro07_M000	 So, how's it going?	Ses02F-impro07-01-01-M000.wav	01
Ses02F_script02_1_M006	 How you doing?  Aw, you know what I forgot?  I forgot to bring my flashlight.  Oh, how could I be so stupid?  I should've brought my flashlight.	Ses02F-script02-07-01-1_M006.wav	07
Ses05M_script02_2_M026	 Because you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This.	Ses05M-script02-05-01-2_M026.wav	05
Ses03M_impro05b_F022	 Uh no I'm not.	Ses03M-impro05b-01-01-F022.wav	01
Ses02F_impro08_F012	 Yes, I completely understand.  Actually, our-our airline only uses five star hotel and above.  Except we charge at a three star hotel rate because, as a corporation, we are able to get a deal from the hotels themselves.	Ses02F-impro08-01-01-F012.wav	01
Ses05F_impro04_F017	 I don't know. Maybe I can take out a loan. I just- I need prospects and I don't feel like I have any.	Ses05F-impro04-04-01-F017.wav	04
Ses02M_script03_2_F011	 It just seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing.	Ses02M-script03-01-01-2_F011.wav	01
Ses02M_impro02_M017	 Our baby has a dad, alright. Daddy is going to be back soon.	Ses02M-impro02-04-01-M017.wav	04
Ses05F_script02_1_M018	 Honey, this is a natural phenomenon. I mean,  It happens like once a year.  It's a great opportunity.	Ses05F-script02-07-01-1_M018.wav	07
Ses02F_script02_2_F006	 We just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like.	Ses02F-script02-05-01-2_F006.wav	05
Ses03F_impro05_M009	 Up to a limit of twenty five dollars.	Ses03F-impro05-01-01-M009.wav	01
Ses01M_impro04_M025	 That's it.	Ses01M-impro04-01-01-M025.wav	01
Ses01F_script03_2_M007	 What about me?	Ses01F-script03-05-01-2_M007.wav	05
Ses04F_script03_1_M017	 Well who knows?	Ses04F-script03-01-01-1_M017.wav	01
Ses05F_script03_2_F033	 Fine, if you insist on being completely insolent.	Ses05F-script03-05-01-2_F033.wav	05
Ses02F_script02_1_M000	 What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight.	Ses02F-script02-07-01-1_M000.wav	07
Ses02F_impro08_F017	 Okay.  Great.  Four seats.  I'll book you for four seats.	Ses02F-impro08-01-01-F017.wav	01
Ses01M_script03_2_M024	 Nonsense.  They have a bag of venom behind of fangs and they snap.	Ses01M-script03-05-01-2_M024.wav	05
Ses05F_script02_1_M023	 Okay, but they are fish that do something that no other fish do.  Like the swallows returning to Capistrano, or the lemmings jumping off a cliff you know like that.	Ses05F-script02-07-01-1_M023.wav	07
Ses05M_script01_1b_M031	 I've given it three years of thought.  I had hoped if I waited, dad would've forgotten him by now and we could have a- a regular wedding and everybody happy.	Ses05M-script01-05-01-1b_M031.wav	05
Ses04M_impro04_F003	 Right, but you have -- I mean, you have to keep on them.  You have to keep calling and reminding them that you're still looking and	Ses04M-impro04-01-01-F003.wav	01

Ses04M_script02_1_M018	 Honey, this is a natural phenomenon.  I mean, this only happens once a year.  It's a great opportunity.  Think about the people in Kansas.  They'd have to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to come see this.  We're just forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up.	Ses04M-script02-07-01-1_M018.wav	07

Ses02M_script01_2_F010	 I want you to act like he's coming back, both of you. Don't you think I haven't noticed since he invited her, I won't stand for any nonsense	Ses02M-script01-05-01-2_F010.wav	05

Ses01M_script02_1_M009	 Oh, well, yeah of course.	Ses01M-script02-01-01-1_M009.wav	01

Ses03M_script01_3_M034	 It was a kind of responsibility, man for man.  You understand me?	Ses03M-script01-04-01-3_M034.wav	04
Ses04F_impro07_M039	 actually, you know, there's this- there's this really cool restaurant, um, I don't know if you-  it's Red Lobster.  It's like down on	Ses04F-impro07-07-01-M039.wav	07

Ses01M_script01_1_F041	 Well, you don't think like that.	Ses01M-script01-05-01-1_F041.wav	05
Ses04M_script02_1_F008	 There is no point in coming down here.	Ses04M-script02-05-01-1_F008.wav	05
Ses05M_impro06_M020	 Thanks.	Ses05M-impro06-04-01-M020.wav	04

Ses05F_impro06_M019	 No problem.	Ses05F-impro06-01-01-M019.wav	01
Ses04F_impro02_M001	 This is really-this is unfair.	Ses04F-impro02-04-01-M001.wav	04
Ses04M_script01_3_M028	 For instance, one time it'd been raining several days.  And this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks; put them in my pocket.  That's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had.	Ses04M-script01-04-01-3_M028.wav	04

Ses01M_script03_2_F011	 I don't see why you want any you already had two glasses.	Ses01M-script03-05-01-2_F011.wav	05
Ses03F_script01_1_M029	 I wanted to get this settled first.	Ses03F-script01-01-01-1_M029.wav	01
Ses02M_script02_1_F005	 Yea.	Ses02M-script02-01-01-1_F005.wav	01

Ses04F_impro05_F009	 You're kidding me, right.  You're going to give me fifty dollars to completely cover my bag, everything that was in it, the inconvenience that I've gone through.  I paid for my ticket.  All I expect is to safely get to my destination with my stuff.  Is that so much to ask?  I mean I really don't think that's that big a deal to ask you guys to have my bag in the place where I leave and then put my bag where I end up.	Ses04F-impro05-05-01-F009.wav	05
Ses02F_script02_1_F001	 What flashlight?	Ses02F-script02-01-01-1_F001.wav	01

Ses03M_script01_1_M011	 Why shouldn't he walk around and dream at him at night.  Walk around.  Why shouldn't he walk around?  Why shouldn't he dream of him, walk around at night waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say flat out that we don't have anymore hope?	Ses03M-script01-05-01-1_M011.wav	05
Ses01M_impro05_M025	 Well you need to find it. Can I just go back there and look through the bags?  Can I just go back there and just go through maybe I'll find it.	Ses01M-impro05-05-01-M025.wav	05
Ses04M_impro01_F021	 Yeah.  Thank you.  Have a pleasant day.	Ses04M-impro01-05-01-F021.wav	05

Ses02M_impro04_F015	 But like, just because you're considering why it's been so difficult doesn't mean you should just stop.	Ses02M-impro04-01-01-F015.wav	01
Ses03F_impro06_M011	 Yeah, but you were there all the hospital days. By his bed-	Ses03F-impro06-04-01-M011.wav	04

Ses05M_script01_1b_M003	 I don't know.  But after he saw it, he ran back into the house and started crying in the kitchen.	Ses05M-script01-04-01-1b_M003.wav	04
Ses01M_impro01_F007	 No, I need your ID to give you a second ID.	Ses01M-impro01-05-01-F007.wav	05

We had a bottle of champagne and no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  We took off our shoes.  And while we were dancing you said the most intimate things to me right in my ear so I could feel them as much as hear them.	Ses05M-script02-04-01-2_F013.wav	04
Ses05F_impro07_M030	 Exactly.  Mooching off of all like the college experiences, that would've been me but you have saved me from that disaster. Thank you. Thank you very much.	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-M030.wav	07

Ses02F_impro04_M015	 That obviously that's not true though.  I mean, you've done this before.  You've done all the work like this before, you know, and and you've gotten people saying oh, you're so good and like you know--	Ses02F-impro04-01-01-M015.wav	01
Ses05F_script03_2_F029	 Why?	Ses05F-script03-05-01-2_F029.wav	05
Ses04F_impro07_M049	 Good. Alright we're so happy.	Ses04F-impro07-07-01-M049.wav	07
Ses02F_script01_3_M029	 I got this idea watching them go down.  Everything was being destroyed, see, but it seemed that there was one new thing being made.  A sort of responsibility.  Man for man.	Ses02F-script01-04-01-3_M029.wav	04
Ses01M_script01_3_M033	 You know, that they were bringing something on to this earth, a kind of sacrifice you know.	Ses01M-script01-04-01-3_M033.wav	04
Ses03M_script01_1_M047	 No you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.	Ses03M-script01-04-01-1_M047.wav	04
Ses01M_impro06_F009	 Well, I'm confused.  He was sick or it was an accident?	Ses01M-impro06-01-01-F009.wav	01
Ses05F_script02_1_M001	 actually I was hoping to go a little bit further up the coast to get away from the lights and the people but I was afraid I will miss it.  How are you doing?	Ses05F-script02-07-01-1_M001.wav	07
Ses03F_impro05_F015	 No, they said I couldn't lock it.	Ses03F-impro05-05-01-F015.wav	05
Ses05F_impro03_F037	 Yeah, we all have to hang out now.	Ses05F-impro03-07-01-F037.wav	07
Ses02F_impro08_F003	 Um, how may I help you.  You're trying to book a specific flight?	Ses02F-impro08-01-01-F003.wav	01
Ses02F_script02_2_F033	 I know that, Augie.  Really, I do.	Ses02F-script02-04-01-2_F033.wav	04
Ses02M_impro06_M010	 She was [garbage]	Ses02M-impro06-04-01-M010.wav	04
Ses05F_impro06_F015	 [BREATHING]	Ses05F-impro06-04-01-F015.wav	04
Ses05F_impro05_M010	 Okay, and what is that?  What kind of bag is it?	Ses05F-impro05-01-01-M010.wav	01
Ses01M_script02_2_M037	 No, no I'm just like you, I thought it was going to be all rosy cheeks and the bills would pay themselves and fish will always come and--	Ses01M-script02-04-01-2_M037.wav	04
Ses04F_impro07_M009	 I know but you should get like a taser or something.  I mean walking around the campus at night-	Ses04F-impro07-01-01-M009.wav	01
Ses01M_impro06_M011	 No, I mean it just came on really quick, you know I mean it was a [GARBAGE] it was a sickness but it just --	Ses01M-impro06-04-01-M011.wav	04
Ses03M_impro04_M024	 Yeah.  It's alright.  But--	Ses03M-impro04-01-01-M024.wav	01
Ses02F_script01_1_M038	 Yes.  I like it an hour a day.  If I'm gonna grub for my money all day long, at least in the evening I want it beautiful.	Ses02F-script01-05-01-1_M038.wav	05
Ses05F_impro06_F005	 Kind of.	Ses05F-impro06-04-01-F005.wav	04
Ses05M_script03_2_F026	 You always had a weak head.	Ses05M-script03-01-01-2_F026.wav	01
Ses05M_script03_1_F026	 Oh, It burnt my comb and all the towels in the bathroom.	Ses05M-script03-07-01-1_F026.wav	07
Ses01M_impro07_F008	 You should...You should look into that.	Ses01M-impro07-07-01-F008.wav	07
Ses04M_impro02_M000	 It's only going to be a year.	Ses04M-impro02-04-01-M000.wav	04
Ses02M_script02_2_F013	 I did want to see them, I always do. I mean I keep thinking that this is going to be the time and it never is.	Ses02M-script02-05-01-2_F013.wav	05
Ses05M_script01_3_M017	 Oh, Annie, we're gonna live now.  I'm going to make you so happy.	Ses05M-script01-07-01-3_M017.wav	07
Ses05F_script01_1_M025	 To hell with that!	Ses05F-script01-05-01-1_M025.wav	05
Ses03F_impro06_F012	 so wrong in so many ways.	Ses03F-impro06-04-01-F012.wav	04
Ses05F_impro06_F021	 It's really bizarre, you know, when you know somebody really well, and then...	Ses05F-impro06-04-01-F021.wav	04
Ses02F_script03_1_M022	 Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow our trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as much as we can.  Like quite idiotic, very small school children.  Let's savor the delight of the moment.	Ses02F-script03-07-01-1_M022.wav	07
Ses05F_impro08_M016	 No, No, No, I am grateful.	Ses05F-impro08-01-01-M016.wav	01
Ses01M_impro06_F000	 You okay?	Ses01M-impro06-01-01-F000.wav	01
Ses03M_impro01_M029	 What is wrong with you?	Ses03M-impro01-05-01-M029.wav	05
Ses03M_script03_2_F032	 Shut up.	Ses03M-script03-05-01-2_F032.wav	05
Ses02M_impro06_F012	 Even if you still do she'll- she'll be there.	Ses02M-impro06-04-01-F012.wav	04
Ses01F_impro04_M021	 Well, sometimes you have to do things that you don't necessarily like to do to have a job. But the job affords you money, you won't have to be taking the bus right now.	Ses01F-impro04-01-01-M021.wav	01
Ses01M_impro04_F000	 You seem kind of down.	Ses01M-impro04-01-01-F000.wav	01
Ses02F_impro07_F002	 Yeah, I'm so excited.  So I'm gonna say--	Ses02F-impro07-07-01-F002.wav	07
Ses02F_script02_2_F021	 No.	Ses02F-script02-04-01-2_F021.wav	04
Ses01M_script03_2_M022	 You know, it's a pity you didn't have any more brandy. It would have made you just a little less disagreeable.	Ses01M-script03-05-01-2_M022.wav	05
Ses03M_script03_2_M008	 Yeah, so am I.  Bored stiff.	Ses03M-script03-05-01-2_M008.wav	05
Ses03M_impro08b_M021	 Yes.  You just tell them Brent Backersen sent you.	Ses03M-impro08b-01-01-M021.wav	01
Ses01M_impro02_M011	 I just got I feel like I'm in shock actually.	Ses01M-impro02-04-01-M011.wav	04
Ses04M_script02_1_M022	 Yeah, they do. Okay.  But it's fish who do something none of the other fish do; like the swallows are returning to Capistrano; or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs, like that.	Ses04M-script02-07-01-1_M022.wav	07
Ses04F_impro07_M060	 I just said the library	Ses04F-impro07-01-01-M060.wav	01
Ses02F_script01_2_M016	 What does that mean?  Me above all?	Ses02F-script01-05-01-2_M016.wav	05
Ses05F_script03_2_F023	 Mind your own business.	Ses05F-script03-05-01-2_F023.wav	05
Ses03F_impro08_F010	 Sir, I'm very sorry, but this is the way it is.  This- We have no control over it.  It's going to take-  -but you have to be patient with us.  You can use a calling card.  We will give you a free calling card to use.	Ses03F-impro08-01-01-F010.wav	01
Ses02F_script01_2_M007	 You can't read her mind.	Ses02F-script01-01-01-2_M007.wav	01
Ses04F_impro02_M024	 I don't know how else to leave it.  What, do you want me to lie to you?	Ses04F-impro02-04-01-M024.wav	04
Ses04M_impro01_M024	 Okay, fine.  I'll go over there.  Thanks, a lot.  You've been really helpful.	Ses04M-impro01-05-01-M024.wav	05
Ses01M_script01_3_F006	 You've been kind of embarrassed ever since I got here.	Ses01M-script01-04-01-3_F006.wav	04
Ses01F_impro02_M001	 I don't understand.  You've already done so much, I don't know why do you have to go back.	Ses01F-impro02-04-01-M001.wav	04
Ses03M_impro06_M030	 I can't do that.	Ses03M-impro06-04-01-M030.wav	04
Ses01F_script01_3_F004	 For one thing, your mother much as told me to go.	Ses01F-script01-01-01-3_F004.wav	01
Ses03M_impro08a_M004	 Olivia. Um. Okay.  So how long has this problem been?	Ses03M-impro08a-01-01-M004.wav	01
Ses02F_script02_2_M007	 There's nothing to it.  We come here, the grunion arrive, they do their little fish business, we go ooh, ah, look at the fish.  They go home. We go home.	Ses02F-script02-01-01-2_M007.wav	01
Ses02M_script02_2_M015	 You were fine during the phone call from Marge, dinner was okay, doing the dishes was no problem, let's see, I took a shower, you watched the news, you said	Ses02M-script02-01-01-2_M015.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_2_F002	 You don't travel seven hundred miles just to see.	Ses03F-script01-05-01-2_F002.wav	05
Ses04F_impro08_M012	 It was a hundred a sixty dollars.  I'm sorry, uh, sixteen dollars.	Ses04F-impro08-01-01-M012.wav	01
Ses02M_impro01_M005	 well is the dri-driver's license going to work?	Ses02M-impro01-01-01-M005.wav	01
Ses02F_script02_2_F031	 Well.  This isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.	Ses02F-script02-04-01-2_F031.wav	04
Ses04F_script03_1_M028	 The one where you bought that little painted wooden snake and put it on my bed.	Ses04F-script03-01-01-1_M028.wav	01
Ses02M_impro07_F006	 big packet is gotta be the real thing. yeah	Ses02M-impro07-07-01-F006.wav	07
Ses04F_script01_1_M038	 The business, the business doesn't inspire me.	Ses04F-script01-05-01-1_M038.wav	05
Ses01F_impro05_M035	 Or you can make a phone call.  But I think a letter might be a little more-- in my impression, letters have more...	Ses01F-impro05-01-01-M035.wav	01
Ses04F_script03_1_F007	 Certainly I shall probably do a court curtsy.	Ses04F-script03-07-01-1_F007.wav	07
Ses02F_script03_1_M017	 No, that desire will fade.  Along with our passion.	Ses02F-script03-01-01-1_M017.wav	01
Ses05M_impro04_F018	 Okay.	Ses05M-impro04-01-01-F018.wav	01
Ses01M_impro04_F002	 What do you mean?	Ses01M-impro04-01-01-F002.wav	01
Ses05M_impro06_M001	 My friend, Shotty, passed away.	Ses05M-impro06-04-01-M001.wav	04
Ses03F_script01_1_F052	 I don't know you, do I?	Ses03F-script01-01-01-1_F052.wav	01
Ses02M_impro06_F004	 It's going to be so rough, I'm sorry.	Ses02M-impro06-04-01-F004.wav	04
Ses04F_impro06_F000	 Thanks.	Ses04F-impro06-04-01-F000.wav	04
Ses02M_impro06_M021	 It's just going to take a while, I think.	Ses02M-impro06-04-01-M021.wav	04
Ses04M_script03_2_F033	 On the contrary, a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_F033.wav	05
Ses03F_impro06_F010	 It's weird, I think. I feel so alone, you know? What am I going to do now? Now that he's gone.	Ses03F-impro06-04-01-F010.wav	04
Ses05F_impro02_M014	 I don't understand why they would just do something like this?	Ses05F-impro02-05-01-M014.wav	05
Ses03F_impro03_F016	 Yeah. It was great.	Ses03F-impro03-07-01-F016.wav	07
Ses04M_script03_2_M051	 You're not going like this.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M051.wav	05
Ses03M_script01_2_F000	 Why did he invite her here?	Ses03M-script01-05-01-2_F000.wav	05
Ses05F_impro05_M017	 No, I understand. I mean. It's got to be tough all those sentimental things, but um- this is all I can do for you.	Ses05F-impro05-01-01-M017.wav	01
Ses03F_script03_2_F013	 It's become a habit with you.	Ses03F-script03-01-01-2_F013.wav	01
Ses03M_script03_2_M046	 Oh.	Ses03M-script03-05-01-2_M046.wav	05
Ses03F_script01_1_M028	 I didn't ask Annie yet.	Ses03F-script01-01-01-1_M028.wav	01
Ses01F_impro03_M024	 That's fair enough.	Ses01F-impro03-01-01-M024.wav	01
Ses02M_script03_1_M015	 Certainly you must, we figures of fun all right.	Ses02M-script03-07-01-1_M015.wav	07
Ses05F_script01_3_F020	 It wouldn't work like this.	Ses05F-script01-04-01-3_F020.wav	04
Ses02M_impro06_M001	 yeah, I mean, you know, it was a -	Ses02M-impro06-04-01-M001.wav	04
Ses03M_script03_2_M021	 I think that	Ses03M-script03-01-01-2_M021.wav	01
Ses01M_impro07_F026	 No, no.  I love softball. I played softball all the time.	Ses01M-impro07-07-01-F026.wav	07
Ses03M_script01_3_F008	 Well, I don't know, embarrassed of her since I came.	Ses03M-script01-04-01-3_F008.wav	04
Ses02F_script02_2_F038	 You're the one who probably wishes you were with someone else.  Someone who--you'd rather enjoy yourself and didn't take everything so hard.	Ses02F-script02-04-01-2_F038.wav	04
Ses05M_script03_2_M028	 I do believe that I have said already that I had three minuet liquor glasses of brandy in the entire evening.  A child of two couldn't get drunk of that.	Ses05M-script03-05-01-2_M028.wav	05
Ses04F_script01_3_M045	 I guess that included you.	Ses04F-script01-04-01-3_M045.wav	04
Ses03F_impro02_F038	 Don't do that to me.	Ses03F-impro02-04-01-F038.wav	04
Ses04F_impro03_M018	 Why not browns?	Ses04F-impro03-01-01-M018.wav	01
Ses03F_impro02_F040	 I know.	Ses03F-impro02-04-01-F040.wav	04
Ses01F_impro05_F029	 I don't think you have done everything you could do because I don't have my bag here yet.	Ses01F-impro05-05-01-F029.wav	05
Ses02M_impro04_F000	 So how you feeling?	Ses02M-impro04-01-01-F000.wav	01
Ses01M_impro02_M014	 Hey listen, it's going to be okay though, all right?	Ses01M-impro02-04-01-M014.wav	04
Ses03F_script01_1_M026	 Every time I reach out for something I have to pull back because other people will suffer. My whole entire life, time and time after time.	Ses03F-script01-04-01-1_M026.wav	04
Ses01M_impro04_F019	 I can't finish the sentence with you without you jumping in...	Ses01M-impro04-01-01-F019.wav	01
Ses03F_impro07_F026	 Oh, and you sit down and you have the sponge bread-- --and eat the--drink the beer. Ugh, I love that stuff. I'm so excited.	Ses03F-impro07-07-01-F026.wav	07
Ses04F_impro07_F048	 Okay well that's not a happy part.  We don't want to talk about that.	Ses04F-impro07-07-01-F048.wav	07
Ses04F_script01_3_M029	 Just about all.	Ses04F-script01-04-01-3_M029.wav	04
Ses05F_script02_1_F015	 I am just not.	Ses05F-script02-01-01-1_F015.wav	01
Ses01M_script01_1_F040	 All right but you don't think like that because what the hell is this all for.  This is all for you, what are we working for Chris? The whole shooting match is for you.	Ses01M-script01-05-01-1_F040.wav	05
Ses01F_impro06_F023	 Umm. Yeah.	Ses01F-impro06-04-01-F023.wav	04
Ses02F_script01_3_M026	 It takes some time for a guy to toss that off.  'Cause they weren't just men.	Ses02F-script01-04-01-3_M026.wav	04
Ses03F_script01_3_M033	 For instance, one time, it had to have been raining several days. There was this one kid, he came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks. Put them in my pocket.	Ses03F-script01-04-01-3_M033.wav	04
Ses01M_impro03_F014	 Dude, you lucked out.	Ses01M-impro03-07-01-F014.wav	07
Ses03F_impro08_M015	 Okay, I need more than this.  Are you going to give me a little bit more?	Ses03F-impro08-05-01-M015.wav	05
Ses03F_impro06_F002	 Mmm hmm. I never knew it was going to be this hard, you know.	Ses03F-impro06-04-01-F002.wav	04
Ses04M_script03_1_F017	 What happens if one of us dies?  Does the one that's left, still laugh?	Ses04M-script03-07-01-1_F017.wav	07
Ses03F_impro03_F007	 he comes up onstage-- And the entire cast everyone just like	Ses03F-impro03-07-01-F007.wav	07
Ses04F_impro07_F012	 And a taser.  Excellent.  Just make sure it's a big knife.	Ses04F-impro07-07-01-F012.wav	07
Ses05M_impro07_F003	 oh,I'm so glad.	Ses05M-impro07-07-01-F003.wav	07
Ses02M_script03_2_M001	 I knew nothing of the sort. You took presents from him.	Ses02M-script03-05-01-2_M001.wav	05
Ses01F_impro07_F013	 I would be like- Oh. Right, right, right.	Ses01F-impro07-07-01-F013.wav	07
Ses02M_script03_1_M016	 No, that desire will fade along with our passion.	Ses02M-script03-04-01-1_M016.wav	04
Ses02F_impro07_F030	 I know.  I'm excited.	Ses02F-impro07-07-01-F030.wav	07
Ses03M_script02_1_M026	 Yeah they do.	Ses03M-script02-07-01-1_M026.wav	07
Ses05M_impro07_M042	 Oh I know, I know.	Ses05M-impro07-07-01-M042.wav	07
Ses05M_script03_1_M015	 uh- the- Being flippant brings out the acid in their damned beauty and light.	Ses05M-script03-07-01-1_M015.wav	07
Ses04F_script02_2_F010	 We never do.  Do we have we ever?	Ses04F-script02-05-01-2_F010.wav	05
Ses01F_impro05_M023	 Actually, we are not necessarily liable to give you- to even give you this fifty dollars so... it's actually- it's actually really	Ses01F-impro05-01-01-M023.wav	01
Ses02M_impro04_M014	 I don't know, it's just not, I don't know - I don't know what to do really, you know, I'm just thinking	Ses02M-impro04-04-01-M014.wav	04
Ses05M_script03_2_M032	 You better turn that off, I think.	Ses05M-script03-05-01-2_M032.wav	05
Ses04M_impro03_F002	 I can't -- how did you do it?  What happened?	Ses04M-impro03-07-01-F002.wav	07

Ses02F_script01_3_M033	 I mean, you can take those things out of a war, but when you drive that car, you've gotta know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've gotta be a little better because of it.	Ses02F-script01-04-01-3_M033.wav	04
Ses03F_script01_1_F005	 He cried hard, huh?	Ses03F-script01-01-01-1_F005.wav	01

Ses03M_script01_3_M036	 And then I came here and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them was a kind of bus accident.	Ses03M-script01-04-01-3_M036.wav	04

Ses05M_script02_1_M031	 And it's single mindedness with no mind. It- It's urgency, it's pure urge.  I mean, they didn't make any decisions.  They don't ask any questions.  They don't give it a name,	Ses05M-script02-07-01-1_M031.wav	07
Ses01M_impro07_F020	 Oh. That is incredible. Is it--	Ses01M-impro07-01-01-F020.wav	01

Ses05M_script01_3_F007	 Well, from her perspective, I mean, why else would I come here?	Ses05M-script01-01-01-3_F007.wav	01

Ses03M_script01_1_M029	 Then I guess that's the end of it.	Ses03M-script01-01-01-1_M029.wav	01
Ses01M_impro06_F012	 Yeah.	Ses01M-impro06-01-01-F012.wav	01

Ses02F_impro04_M017	 Well, you've gotta live.	Ses02F-impro04-01-01-M017.wav	01
Ses05F_impro05_F019	 No, but I mean like why can't- why can't you find it?  Where did it go?  Who lost it?	Ses05F-impro05-05-01-F019.wav	05
Ses04M_script01_1_M014	 For God's sake, three years.  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane.	Ses04M-script01-05-01-1_M014.wav	05
Ses02M_impro03_F028	 Yay, well congratulations, that's so cool. [BREATHING] I can't wait.	Ses02M-impro03-07-01-F028.wav	07
Ses02F_script01_3_M028	 They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today.	Ses02F-script01-04-01-3_M028.wav	04
Ses04M_script01_3_F023	 Oh, gees.	Ses04M-script01-04-01-3_F023.wav	04

Ses02F_script01_3_M023	 It's all mixed up with so many other things.  You remember overseas, I was in command of a company?	Ses02F-script01-04-01-3_M023.wav	04
Ses04F_impro07_M006	 That's amazing.  Wow.	Ses04F-impro07-07-01-M006.wav	07
Ses04M_script02_2_M031	 And we'll have three fat rosy kids and ha, ha, ha, baby, the joke's on us, 'cause you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This.	Ses04M-script02-05-01-2_M031.wav	05
Ses05F_impro05_F024	 That's all you can offer me? I mean, my the stuff in there is worth way more than fifty dollar.	Ses05F-impro05-05-01-F024.wav	05
Ses05M_script03_2_M044	 oh! Marry you again? I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling to me on bended knee.	Ses05M-script03-05-01-2_M044.wav	05
Ses05M_impro08_M020	 Well, if it does happen again, let me give you my direct number and you can call me.  Actually, I'll give you my cell number. Um- It's --	Ses05M-impro08-01-01-M020.wav	01
Ses05M_script01_1_M035	 I have been a good son for too long.  A good sucker.  I'm through with it.	Ses05M-script01-05-01-1_M035.wav	05
Ses01M_script01_3_F008	 From her point of view why else would I come?	Ses01M-script01-01-01-3_F008.wav	01
Ses04M_impro04_F009	 I mean, I'm not saying that you should, you know--	Ses04M-impro04-01-01-F009.wav	01
Ses01M_impro05_F004	 There's no need for you to raise your voice, sir.	Ses01M-impro05-01-01-F004.wav	01
Ses05F_script03_1_M026	 Horrible thing, I hate it.	Ses05F-script03-07-01-1_M026.wav	07
Ses03M_impro05a_M020	 What is the matter with you?	Ses03M-impro05a-05-01-M020.wav	05
Ses03M_impro05b_F021	 Well, the entire flight, sir, the luggage was placed on another plane that never actually left Baltimore.	Ses03M-impro05b-01-01-F021.wav	01
Ses03M_impro06_F018	 Yeah.	Ses03M-impro06-04-01-F018.wav	04
Ses05F_impro06_M014	 Of course not.  You have no idea what it's like to lose a kid.	Ses05F-impro06-04-01-M014.wav	04
Ses03M_impro03_F003	 Chuck E. Cheese?  Ah, man that is so lame.	Ses03M-impro03-07-01-F003.wav	07
Ses01M_script02_2_F019	 Do you remember the first year we came here? It's about four years ago right after we got married.	Ses01M-script02-01-01-2_F019.wav	01
Ses04F_script02_1_M021	 Think about the people in Kansas.  They'd have to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to come see this.  We're just forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up.	Ses04F-script02-07-01-1_M021.wav	07
Ses01M_impro03_M018	 Just cash hardcore.	Ses01M-impro03-01-01-M018.wav	01
Ses02M_script02_2_F022	 No.	Ses02M-script02-04-01-2_F022.wav	04
Ses02M_script03_2_M043	 You're not going like this.	Ses02M-script03-05-01-2_M043.wav	05
Ses02M_impro06_F008	 Yes. Well, at least you have a lot of good memories.	Ses02M-impro06-04-01-F008.wav	04
Ses03F_impro01_M002	 You didn't fill this out right. All right. It says that you have to fill out the back sheet of this, but you filled out the yellow sheet of it.	Ses03F-impro01-01-01-M002.wav	01
Ses05M_impro07_F037	 Yeah.	Ses05M-impro07-07-01-F037.wav	07
Ses02M_script01_2_M016	 What does that mean, me above all?	Ses02M-script01-05-01-2_M016.wav	05
Ses02M_script02_1_M003	 How you doing?	Ses02M-script02-07-01-1_M003.wav	07
Ses01M_impro03_F018	 Yeah.	Ses01M-impro03-01-01-F018.wav	01
Ses02M_script01_1_M037	 I've been a good son too long a good sucker, I'm through with it.	Ses02M-script01-05-01-1_M037.wav	05
Ses05M_script03_2_M008	 Well, that's a nice point of view I must say.	Ses05M-script03-05-01-2_M008.wav	05
Ses03F_script03_2_F042	 Yes I am. Let go of me. I hate you and I loath you. God, I can't believe I just finally realized how you are. I am never marry you. Never. Never, never, never. I would rather die in torment.	Ses03F-script03-05-01-2_F042.wav	05
Ses05F_impro02_F035	 "sigh" Three weeks.	Ses05F-impro02-04-01-F035.wav	04
Ses03M_impro07_M009	 What does that mean?	Ses03M-impro07-01-01-M009.wav	01
Ses05M_impro06_M013	 and it just gets worse.  It just gets worse, everything is bad all the time; people die, your friends die, family dies, your best friends die. it's-	Ses05M-impro06-04-01-M013.wav	04
Ses01F_script03_2_M019	 Yes it is.	Ses01F-script03-01-01-2_M019.wav	01
Ses05M_script02_1_F001	 What flashlight?	Ses05M-script02-01-01-1_F001.wav	01
Ses01M_impro02_M012	 I don't know.	Ses01M-impro02-04-01-M012.wav	04
Ses05M_impro04_M041	 I'll need it.	Ses05M-impro04-04-01-M041.wav	04
Ses05M_impro03_M029	 Well, we're going to take a little bit of time, you know, we need to get acclimated and you know start our lives, make money, you know be comfortable.	Ses05M-impro03-07-01-M029.wav	07
Ses04M_script02_2_F032	 I didn't say that.	Ses04M-script02-04-01-2_F032.wav	04
Ses04M_impro03_F007	 Yeah, it is.	Ses04M-impro03-07-01-F007.wav	07
Ses02F_impro04_M010	 It's not worthless 'cause it's definitely gonna--it's definitely gonna pay off.  I know it.  I mean, I can--I've just--I've seen your work etiquette.  You know, you're a good worker and...	Ses02F-impro04-01-01-M010.wav	01
Ses03M_impro06_M021	 I mean I haven't even talked to him on the phone for the past three months.	Ses03M-impro06-04-01-M021.wav	04
Ses04M_script03_1_F009	 It's true.  The whole business is a very poor joke.	Ses04M-script03-07-01-1_F009.wav	07
Ses01M_impro05_M031	 Thank you very much.	Ses01M-impro05-05-01-M031.wav	05
Ses03F_impro06_M014	 I don't know.	Ses03F-impro06-04-01-M014.wav	04
Ses05F_impro02_F021	 I don't think there's anything we can do.	Ses05F-impro02-04-01-F021.wav	04
Ses01M_script02_1_F008	 I'm fine.	Ses01M-script02-01-01-1_F008.wav	01
Ses04M_script03_1_F018	 Well that's serious enough, isn't it?	Ses04M-script03-07-01-1_F018.wav	07
Ses02F_script03_1_M029	 The worst one was in Cannes when your curling iron burnt a hole in my new dressing gown.	Ses02F-script03-01-01-1_M029.wav	01
Ses03M_script01_3_M041	 Otherwise what you have is loot and there's blood on it.	Ses03M-script01-04-01-3_M041.wav	04
Ses05M_impro07_F044	 All right.  Wow.  So exciting.	Ses05M-impro07-07-01-F044.wav	07
Ses01F_script01_3_M004	 What?	Ses01F-script01-01-01-3_M004.wav	01
Ses05M_impro05_M001	 So, um, what do I do?	Ses05M-impro05-01-01-M001.wav	01
Ses01M_impro07_M005	 Yeah, everything. Every like- free ride and I get to, you know, like be on like a Trojans sports team too. And it's like cool. Isn't it awesome?	Ses01M-impro07-07-01-M005.wav	07
Ses03M_impro07_M015	 Oh my God the first minute I got it I sent it back in.	Ses03M-impro07-07-01-M015.wav	07
Ses04F_script02_2_M000	 Well, so what do you think?	Ses04F-script02-01-01-2_M000.wav	01
Ses04M_script01_2_F013	 Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.	Ses04M-script01-05-01-2_F013.wav	05
Ses02F_script03_1_M013	 All those futile moralists that try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.  Laugh at everything.  All their sacred shibboleths.	Ses02F-script03-01-01-1_M013.wav	01
Ses01F_impro02_F017	 We've got friends, that's why we moved here, huh?  Because there is a day care down the street.	Ses01F-impro02-04-01-F017.wav	04
Ses01M_script03_2_M043	 Shut up. Shut up. I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling back to me on a bended knee. You are an evil tempered little vampire and I never want to see you again as long as I live.	Ses01M-script03-05-01-2_M043.wav	05
Ses04F_impro03_M035	 Well I can't be in charge of this.  I mean I got things I got to do.	Ses04F-impro03-01-01-M035.wav	01
Ses04M_impro03_F006	 I can't believe this.  You're getting married. It's crazy!	Ses04M-impro03-07-01-F006.wav	07
Ses01F_impro04_M014	 Well maybe we should sit down some time and you can just tell me all the stuff that you have done and I'll write it out.	Ses01F-impro04-01-01-M014.wav	01
Ses02M_script02_2_F031	 Well, but this isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.	Ses02M-script02-04-01-2_F031.wav	04
Ses04M_script01_2_F001	 Why does that bother you?	Ses04M-script01-01-01-2_F001.wav	01
Ses01F_impro02_F020	 And I want lots and lots and lots of pictures.	Ses01F-impro02-04-01-F020.wav	04
Ses03M_impro05a_M007	 God.	Ses03M-impro05a-05-01-M007.wav	05
Ses04F_script03_2_F025	 You're quite insufferable.  I expect it's because you're drunk.	Ses04F-script03-05-01-2_F025.wav	05
Ses02M_impro05_F014	 So we'll- what we'll do	Ses02M-impro05-01-01-F014.wav	01
Ses01M_impro06_M012	 What?	Ses01M-impro06-04-01-M012.wav	04
Ses01M_impro02_M025	 I love you.	Ses01M-impro02-04-01-M025.wav	04
Ses05M_script02_2_M005	 uh, Carla Can I ask you a question?  no, don't get upset, but are you having your period?	Ses05M-script02-01-01-2_M005.wav	01
Ses02M_script03_1_F012	 Who's they?	Ses02M-script03-07-01-1_F012.wav	07
Ses02F_script01_1_F006	 What was he doing out here at that hour?	Ses02F-script01-04-01-1_F006.wav	04
Ses04F_script03_1_F028	 Then the manager came in and found us rolling about on the floor biting and scratching like panthers.	Ses04F-script03-07-01-1_F028.wav	07
Ses02F_script02_2_M001	 What I was saying.	Ses02F-script02-01-01-2_M001.wav	01
Ses03M_script03_2_M041	 Very amusing indeed.	Ses03M-script03-05-01-2_M041.wav	05
Ses03M_script02_2_F023	 I'd rather not remember something...	Ses03M-script02-04-01-2_F023.wav	04
Ses01M_script01_3_F015	 Because I was waiting for you, Chris.  Till then you never wrote me and then when you did, well, you sure can be ambiguous you know.	Ses01M-script01-07-01-3_F015.wav	07
Ses01F_script01_1_F034	 Just give it some more thought.	Ses01F-script01-01-01-1_F034.wav	01
Ses02M_script01_2_F002	 Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.	Ses02M-script01-05-01-2_F002.wav	05
Ses05M_impro06_F010	 If there's anything I can do to be there for you.	Ses05M-impro06-04-01-F010.wav	04
Ses05M_impro04_F008	 L.A. is really hard.  I mean, have you tried like just going into a bar a couple of times to make friends with people who work there? and	Ses05M-impro04-01-01-F008.wav	01
Ses01M_impro03_M020	 Yeah, like a big like- A wedding on the beach, that would be nice.	Ses01M-impro03-07-01-M020.wav	07
Ses05F_script01_3_M037	 It felt wrong to be alive-to open that bank-book; to buy that new car; to look at that new refrigerator.  I mean, you can take those things out of the war, but if you drive that car, you have to know that that comes from the love that a man has for a man.  And you've got to be a little bit better than that!	Ses05F-script01-04-01-3_M037.wav	04
Ses03M_script01_2_F012	 No.  Nobody in my house better dare and challenge her faith.  You know and maybe strangers but not his father, not his brother.	Ses03M-script01-05-01-2_F012.wav	05
Ses01F_script01_1_M014	 You know.	Ses01F-script01-01-01-1_M014.wav	01
Ses04M_impro08_M026	 God, that's like a whole problem with like-- But, no, I mean, hey-- if you ever	Ses04M-impro08-01-01-M026.wav	01
Ses05M_impro08_M008	 Okay.  Does your D.S.L. cable, you know, travel a long distance by any chance? - Does it go through any windows?  I mean, is it --	Ses05M-impro08-01-01-M008.wav	01
Ses03F_impro04_M012	 What would you do- What would you do if you didn't? You can go to law school.	Ses03F-impro04-01-01-M012.wav	01
Ses03M_impro01_F000	 Is that a demand sir?	Ses03M-impro01-01-01-F000.wav	01
Ses01F_impro03_M020	 But the pennies always get you because you end up spending like, you know, fifty bucks.	Ses01F-impro03-01-01-M020.wav	01
Ses05F_impro03_M001	 Come on, what?	Ses05F-impro03-07-01-M001.wav	07
Ses05M_impro01_M015	 Wouldn't you? Oh, come on.  you just tell me.  You would make an exception for me.	Ses05M-impro01-05-01-M015.wav	05
Ses05F_script03_2_M016	 Oh, that reply has broken my heart.	Ses05F-script03-05-01-2_M016.wav	05
Ses02F_impro08_F022	 So, it's a five hour flight, but you'll arrive only at eleven a clock in the morning.  So that day, you can have plenty of time to get to your hotel--Rest up and then still have a nice afternoon your first afternoon in Maui.	Ses02F-impro08-01-01-F022.wav	01
Ses05F_impro06_M020	 Right, it just doesn't make any sense, it's not real.  It doesn't feel real.	Ses05F-impro06-04-01-M020.wav	04
Ses04M_script01_1_F032	 Yes we did. Do you want to keep going?	Ses04M-script01-01-01-1_F032.wav	01
Ses03M_script01_3_M029	 Just about all.	Ses03M-script01-04-01-3_M029.wav	04
Ses04M_impro06_F002	 I know- I know there's nothing I can say that will really help, but--	Ses04M-impro06-04-01-F002.wav	04
Ses01F_impro04_M007	 You did?	Ses01F-impro04-01-01-M007.wav	01
Ses03M_impro05b_F008	 the luggage was left in Baltimore.  Therefore--	Ses03M-impro05b-01-01-F008.wav	01
Ses04F_script02_1_F007	 It's after eleven let's go home.	Ses04F-script02-05-01-1_F007.wav	05
Ses05F_impro06_M002	 That's the worst.  I'm so sorry.  Did you know him well?	Ses05F-impro06-04-01-M002.wav	04
Ses05M_impro08_F005	 Uh, yeah.  We've pinned it a couple of times.	Ses05M-impro08-01-01-F005.wav	01
Ses02M_impro07_F012	 Yay.	Ses02M-impro07-07-01-F012.wav	07
Ses03M_script03_2_M012	 Oh my...just because I just...okay...	Ses03M-script03-05-01-2_M012.wav	05
Ses01M_impro01_F000	 Next.	Ses01M-impro01-05-01-F000.wav	05
Ses01F_impro04_M019	 Yeah.	Ses01F-impro04-01-01-M019.wav	01
Ses01M_script01_3_F001	 Oh it's not bad thing it's good thing.	Ses01M-script01-01-01-3_F001.wav	01
Ses05M_impro01_F002	 Right, but this is the wrong form.  Somebody gave you the wrong form.	Ses05M-impro01-01-01-F002.wav	01
Ses01M_script01_3_M020	 Do you want to go somewhere?  Let's go.	Ses01M-script01-04-01-3_M020.wav	04
Ses03F_impro06_F019	 Not very good.	Ses03F-impro06-04-01-F019.wav	04
Ses03F_impro08_F029	 Okay? Thank you for calling.  Goodbye.	Ses03F-impro08-01-01-F029.wav	01
Ses01F_script01_1_F015	 Well I got an idea, but what's your story?	Ses01F-script01-01-01-1_F015.wav	01
Ses03M_impro08b_M016	 Go in there, yeah, go in there.  Tell them Brent Backersen sent you.	Ses03M-impro08b-01-01-M016.wav	01
Ses02F_impro06_M006	 It's okay.	Ses02F-impro06-01-01-M006.wav	01
Ses03M_script01_1_M028	 I wanted to get this settled first.	Ses03M-script01-01-01-1_M028.wav	01
Ses04M_script03_2_F051	 Never, never, never.  I'd rather die in torment. Beast brute.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_F051.wav	05
Ses03F_script02_2_M026	 A-a back rub, some ice cream, a suicide pact. What the hell do you want, Carla?	Ses03F-script02-05-01-2_M026.wav	05
Ses03M_impro07_M016	 So...	Ses03M-impro07-07-01-M016.wav	07
Ses04M_impro05_M014	 No, no, because, look, I don't care what your policy says.  I mean--	Ses04M-impro05-05-01-M014.wav	05
Ses04F_impro03_F000	 I have something to tell you.	Ses04F-impro03-07-01-F000.wav	07
Ses02M_script02_1_M005	 Although, I guess you can't tell it probably isn't them. Probably be unmistakable don't you think?	Ses02M-script02-07-01-1_M005.wav	07

Ses04F_script02_1_M035	 No one sent them a map or an invitation.  Just some little instinctual time release firecracker went off in their little bodies and all as one. They turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming.	Ses04F-script02-07-01-1_M035.wav	07
Ses05M_script01_3_M030	 I mean that exactly, anymore selfish -- just a little bit more selfish and they would have been here today. And it gave me an idea as I was watching them all go down.	Ses05M-script01-04-01-3_M030.wav	04

Ses01F_script02_1_M033	 Ahh...we weren't in a good spot.	Ses01F-script02-01-01-1_M033.wav	01

Ses02M_impro08_M020	 Uh-ha, I mean usually sites are pretty well protected but sometimes I mean information gets out, so	Ses02M-impro08-01-01-M020.wav	01
Ses01F_impro02_F003	 I guess, you know, everybody has to make sacrifices.	Ses01F-impro02-01-01-F003.wav	01
Ses02M_impro06_M018	 Then she's gone.	Ses02M-impro06-04-01-M018.wav	04

Ses02M_impro04_F012	 So you should take that in consideration rather than giving yourself such a hard time.	Ses02M-impro04-01-01-F012.wav	01
Ses05M_script01_1b_M041	 No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.	Ses05M-script01-05-01-1b_M041.wav	05

Ses04M_script01_1_F029	 I don't see why it has to be Annie.	Ses04M-script01-05-01-1_F029.wav	05
