Ses02M_script02_1_M039	 Just all as one. This little time sensitive firecracker, instinctual firecracker in their body just went off and all as one they turned and formed a line as long the California coast and started swimming. They're swimming right now as if that's the only thing that matters.	Ses02M-script02-07-01-1_M039.wav	07

Ses04M_impro07_F007	 Yes.	Ses04M-impro07-07-01-F007.wav	07

Ses05F_script03_1_M017	 It all depends on how well we played.	Ses05F-script03-07-01-1_M017.wav	07
Ses02F_script02_2_F020	 I'd rather not remember some things.  I would rather not hope for some things.	Ses02F-script02-04-01-2_F020.wav	04
Ses03M_script03_2_M011	 No particular reason.  Anyhow they were very small ones.	Ses03M-script03-05-01-2_M011.wav	05

Ses04M_impro04_F003	 Right, but you have -- I mean, you have to keep on them.  You have to keep calling and reminding them that you're still looking and	Ses04M-impro04-01-01-F003.wav	01
Ses05F_script01_3_M028	 for instance, there's this one time.  It had been raining for several days.  And this kid came up to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks. you know, He just put them in my pocket.	Ses05F-script01-04-01-3_M028.wav	04
Ses04M_script03_1_M033	 As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.	Ses04M-script03-01-01-1_M033.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_1_M053	 No, you don't. I'm a pretty tough guy.	Ses03F-script01-01-01-1_M053.wav	01

Ses02M_script01_1_M024	 I don't know why but every time I reach out for something that I really want, I have to pull back 'cause someone else will suffer. My whole bloody life, time after time after time.	Ses02M-script01-05-01-1_M024.wav	05
Ses02F_script02_1_M028	 Alright.  But it's fish that do something that none of the other fish do.  Like the swallows returning to Capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs.	Ses02F-script02-07-01-1_M028.wav	07
Ses02M_script02_2_M010	 Well, we'll see them this year.	Ses02M-script02-01-01-2_M010.wav	01

Ses03F_impro02_F029	 Look, I need you to be strong for me. 'Cause I can't be the only one that's strong right now, really, I--	Ses03F-impro02-04-01-F029.wav	04
Ses04M_script02_1_M009	 Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  We should have brought the blanket, our blanket.	Ses04M-script02-01-01-1_M009.wav	01
Ses05F_impro08_M007	 Like I know I paid last month, but it hasn't been paid and you charged me a late fee.	Ses05F-impro08-05-01-M007.wav	05

Ses02F_script02_1_M012	 I wonder, do they always run during a full moon?  I can't remember if it was full last year.  Do you remember?	Ses02F-script02-01-01-1_M012.wav	01
Ses05M_impro06_F010	 If there's anything I can do to be there for you.	Ses05M-impro06-04-01-F010.wav	04
Ses01M_impro06_F016	 Mmhmm.	Ses01M-impro06-01-01-F016.wav	01
Ses04F_script02_1_F014	 What are you so excited about?  This isn't a moon landing we're talking about.  It's fish.  It's fish nobody even eats.	Ses04F-script02-05-01-1_F014.wav	05
Ses04F_impro07_M005	 That's awesome.  Congratulations.	Ses04F-impro07-07-01-M005.wav	07

Ses04F_impro07_F074	 Oh, oh, I'm sorry, my bad.  I'll have to, like, sign up for summer lessons from you before I go.  You can teach me how to be cool before I go to college.	Ses04F-impro07-07-01-F074.wav	07
Ses05M_script01_3_F016	 Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  What's the matter?	Ses05M-script01-04-01-3_F016.wav	04
Ses05F_script02_2_M025	 What.  Welcome to the human race.	Ses05F-script02-05-01-2_M025.wav	05
Ses02M_script02_2_M002	 Certainly it's not. Slightly exaggerated scientific fact.	Ses02M-script02-01-01-2_M002.wav	01
Ses05F_impro06_F021	 It's really bizarre, you know, when you know somebody really well, and then...	Ses05F-impro06-04-01-F021.wav	04
Ses02M_script02_2_M020	 Of course, I see it now; you want this to be like that other time, right? That's it, right?	Ses02M-script02-07-01-2_M020.wav	07

Ses01M_impro05_F004	 There's no need for you to raise your voice, sir.	Ses01M-impro05-01-01-F004.wav	01
Ses02M_impro04_F011	 and the fact that you know there is always different types of things and what kind of people they want in the office and whether it's male or female or you know what I mean, like things are out of your control.	Ses02M-impro04-01-01-F011.wav	01
