Ses05F_impro04_F008	 I still can't live on in six seven and five.  It's not possible in Los Angeles.  Housing is too expensive.	Ses05F-impro04-05-01-F008.wav	05

Ses05F_impro05_M015	 Sentimental value.	Ses05F-impro05-01-01-M015.wav	01

Ses05F_impro05_F021	 Yeah, meaning I didn't die in a fiery plane crash.  How convenient, but um- I paid two thousand dollar to ride your airline, and I would really appreciate getting my bags there to my destination in one place.	Ses05F-impro05-05-01-F021.wav	05
Ses03F_impro06_F008	 I loved that boy.	Ses03F-impro06-04-01-F008.wav	04

Ses05F_impro06_M023	 That's the best way to put it.	Ses05F-impro06-01-01-M023.wav	01
Ses03F_impro06_F023	 He was like, he was like my brother, you know.	Ses03F-impro06-04-01-F023.wav	04
