Ses03F_impro08_F002	 Yes, sir, I'm very sorry, but we've had some trouble here.  There's been a lot of calls and the system has-	Ses03F-impro08-01-01-F002.wav	01
Ses05F_impro07_F029	 Better than if I'd picked up and moved to Boston.	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-F029.wav	07
Ses05F_impro07_F031	 you'd be that kid	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-F031.wav	07
Ses03F_impro08_F006	 You're going to have to just be patient with us, sir, as we	Ses03F-impro08-01-01-F006.wav	01
Ses03F_impro08_F014	 And we will probably send you a calling card.  I'm very sorry.  You're just going to have to be patient, sir.	Ses03F-impro08-01-01-F014.wav	01
Ses03F_impro08_F023	 Oh, well, I'm sorry about that. Umm- We-	Ses03F-impro08-01-01-F023.wav	01
Ses05F_impro07_M009	 I don't know.  Well.  I wouldn't mind living by the U.S.C. campus, you know, but I'm not going to go to school right now, so.	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-M009.wav	07
Ses05F_impro07_M011	 But I'd love to go all the US- all the U.S.C. parties and do all that crazy stuff with you.	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-M011.wav	07
Ses05F_impro07_M012	 it is going to be so much fun. Yes.	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-M012.wav	07
Ses05F_impro07_M013	 Uh! I'm so happy that you're not going to go away.	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-M013.wav	07
Ses03F_impro08_F028	 and we will take care of it if anything happens.  But all we can do now is ask for your patience.	Ses03F-impro08-01-01-F028.wav	01
Ses05F_impro07_M014	 Oh, I bet you're going to love it too.  You always wanted to go to U.S.C..	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-M014.wav	07
Ses01F_impro03_F019	 Yeah.	Ses01F-impro03-01-01-F019.wav	01
Ses03F_impro08_M021	 About three million dollars.	Ses03F-impro08-01-01-M021.wav	01
Ses01F_impro03_F023	 Yeah.	Ses01F-impro03-01-01-F023.wav	01
Ses01F_impro03_M000	 So what's up?  What's new?	Ses01F-impro03-01-01-M000.wav	01
Ses01F_impro03_M001	 Yeah.  I heard.	Ses01F-impro03-01-01-M001.wav	01
Ses03F_impro08_M006	 You know what?  I'm just going to- Patient?  I'm a busy man.	Ses03F-impro08-05-01-M006.wav	05
Ses03F_impro08_M010	 Oh, my God.	Ses03F-impro08-05-01-M010.wav	05
Ses05F_impro07_M017	 That'll be great. That'll be great.	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-M017.wav	07
Ses01F_impro03_M011	 Yeah.  But he'll have like a long visa.  Can you go visit then for a long time?	Ses01F-impro03-01-01-M011.wav	01
Ses05F_impro07_M018	 We should try to find, like, a party spot though, like you know where there's going to be a lot of parties, where there are cool people, though.  Do you know any people that might be out there?	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-M018.wav	07
Ses05F_impro07_M019	 Yeah, me either.	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-M019.wav	07
Ses05F_impro07_M025	 I know exactly how you feel about that. I think you feel really excited about it.  I know you are. I can tell. I know you.	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-M025.wav	07
Ses01F_impro03_M021	 like, wait, but it's just pennies.  You're like, wait a minute I'm on to you.	Ses01F-impro03-01-01-M021.wav	01
Ses01F_impro04_F000	 Uh, what?  Craig's List?  Oh the internet thing?	Ses01F-impro04-01-01-F000.wav	01
Ses05F_impro08_F000	 Hi, sir.  How can I help you?	Ses05F-impro08-01-01-F000.wav	01
Ses01F_impro04_F005	 He just...	Ses01F-impro04-01-01-F005.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_1_F031	 There's nothing wrong with it.	Ses03F-script01-01-01-1_F031.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_1_F045	 Tell me something.	Ses03F-script01-01-01-1_F045.wav	01
Ses05F_impro08_F003	 I kwon, it is ridiculous	Ses05F-impro08-01-01-F003.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_1_M001	 He was out there when it happened.	Ses03F-script01-01-01-1_M001.wav	01
Ses05F_impro08_F009	 In the mail?	Ses05F-impro08-01-01-F009.wav	01
Ses05F_impro08_F011	 Okay.	Ses05F-impro08-01-01-F011.wav	01
Ses01F_impro04_M006	 He's like a house manager. Yeah.  It's a good job.	Ses01F-impro04-01-01-M006.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_1_M006	 I guess he is.	Ses03F-script01-01-01-1_M006.wav	01
Ses05F_impro08_F017	 Okay, I do see that on here, and it says that um, it had some trouble clearing for some reason.  And I think that was the problem on our end.  So um-	Ses05F-impro08-01-01-F017.wav	01
Ses05F_impro08_F018	 Well you know sometimes-- just with online transactions, things happens. so um-	Ses05F-impro08-01-01-F018.wav	01
Ses01F_impro04_M011	 I don't know.  He had a really good resume I guess and--	Ses01F-impro04-01-01-M011.wav	01
Ses01F_impro04_M013	 It's kind of helpful when getting a job.	Ses01F-impro04-01-01-M013.wav	01
Ses05F_impro08_F023	 Right, right, and since--yeah, since it was just a computer glitch, then that's that should be cleared up as well.  So I'm going to go ahead and try and put that into the computer.  And if for some reason you notice on your statement in a few days that you've been charged and an overdue fee, then you should just call back and we'll have that.	Ses05F-impro08-01-01-F023.wav	01
Ses01F_impro04_M016	 Yeah.  But the piece of paper helps, too.	Ses01F-impro04-01-01-M016.wav	01
Ses01F_impro04_M019	 Yeah.	Ses01F-impro04-01-01-M019.wav	01
Ses01F_impro04_M020	 Okay, yeah.  I would imagine.	Ses01F-impro04-01-01-M020.wav	01
Ses05F_impro08_F027	 ahh one eight hundred three two three	Ses05F-impro08-01-01-F027.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_1_M042	 I'll get out. I'll marry her somewhere else. Maybe New York.	Ses03F-script01-01-01-1_M042.wav	01
Ses05F_impro08_F029	 You're welcome	Ses05F-impro08-01-01-F029.wav	01
Ses05F_impro08_F032	 Have a good day.	Ses05F-impro08-01-01-F032.wav	01
Ses01F_impro04_M025	 I am riding the bus, but by choice.	Ses01F-impro04-01-01-M025.wav	01
Ses01F_impro04_M026	 To save the environment, carpool.	Ses01F-impro04-01-01-M026.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_1_M052	 I am thinking like that.	Ses03F-script01-01-01-1_M052.wav	01
Ses05F_impro07_F001	 I got into college.	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-F001.wav	07
Ses05F_impro08_M013	 Okay, great, go ahead.	Ses05F-impro08-01-01-M013.wav	01
Ses05F_impro08_M022	 Right.	Ses05F-impro08-01-01-M022.wav	01
Ses01F_impro04_F029	 Who do you think you are?	Ses01F-impro04-05-01-F029.wav	05
Ses01F_impro04_F031	 Oh.  I'm saving the environment. I'm riding this car because I- I want to.	Ses01F-impro04-05-01-F031.wav	05
Ses03F_script01_3_M001	 You're not sorry you came?	Ses03F-script01-01-01-3_M001.wav	01
Ses01F_impro05_M003	 Okay.	Ses01F-impro05-01-01-M003.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_3_M004	 What?	Ses03F-script01-01-01-3_M004.wav	01
Ses01F_impro05_M005	 Okay.  Great.  I'm really sorry that you had to do that.  What's your last name?  Let's start there.	Ses01F-impro05-01-01-M005.wav	01
Ses05F_script01_2_M002	 What did you mean? He lived next door to the girl all of his life, why wouldn't he want to see her again? Don't look at me like that, he didn't tell me any more than he told you.	Ses05F-script01-01-01-2_M002.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_3_F008	 Well, you've been embarrassed ever since I came.	Ses03F-script01-04-01-3_F008.wav	04
Ses03F_script01_3_F026	 Well then tell me what's wrong. I mean, even in your letters there's something ashamed.	Ses03F-script01-04-01-3_F026.wav	04
Ses01F_impro05_M014	 No, no.	Ses01F-impro05-01-01-M014.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_3_F028	 But, Chris, it wouldn't work like this.	Ses03F-script01-04-01-3_F028.wav	04
Ses03F_script01_3_F029	 Yeah, sure.	Ses03F-script01-04-01-3_F029.wav	04
Ses03F_script01_3_F033	 Because you can't feel that way, never again, Chris. You hear me? Never. I mean, the money and me too.	Ses03F-script01-04-01-3_F033.wav	04
Ses05F_script01_1_F008	 What's the meaning of that?	Ses05F-script01-04-01-1_F008.wav	04
Ses01F_impro05_M026	 You know, the airlines can not be held responsible for every bag of luggage that comes through here.	Ses01F-impro05-01-01-M026.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_3_M029	 You know when I went overseas. I said I was in command of a company.	Ses03F-script01-04-01-3_M029.wav	04
Ses03F_script01_3_M036	 Everything was being destroyed, see, but there was one new thing that was being created. A kind of responsibility, man for man. You understand me?	Ses03F-script01-04-01-3_M036.wav	04
Ses01F_impro05_F011	 Is this a joke?	Ses01F-impro05-05-01-F011.wav	05
Ses03F_script01_3_M039	 And I went to work with dad and that rat race again. And I felt what you said-ashamed somehow. Because nobody was changed at all. It seemed to make a sucker out of a lot of guys.	Ses03F-script01-04-01-3_M039.wav	04
Ses05F_script01_3_F023	 Oh gee.	Ses05F-script01-04-01-3_F023.wav	04
Ses03F_script01_1_F017	 It's those Goddamn newspapers, you know? I mean, it's like every day they come out with this new person that comes along. And the next one's going to be Larry.	Ses03F-script01-05-01-1_F017.wav	05
Ses01F_impro05_F018	 Do you understand who my husband is?	Ses01F-impro05-05-01-F018.wav	05
Ses03F_script01_1_M021	 See, then it's not just my business. God, you have	Ses03F-script01-05-01-1_M021.wav	05
Ses05F_script01_3_M024	 Remember when I was overseas?  I was in command of the company.	Ses05F-script01-04-01-3_M024.wav	04
Ses01F_impro05_F021	 You are cruising for a bruising.  You are in so much trouble.	Ses01F-impro05-05-01-F021.wav	05
Ses05F_script01_3_M025	 Yeah.  I lost them.	Ses05F-script01-04-01-3_M025.wav	04
Ses01F_impro05_F023	 Because I probably know him.	Ses01F-impro05-05-01-F023.wav	05
Ses03F_script01_2_F002	 You don't travel seven hundred miles just to see.	Ses03F-script01-05-01-2_F002.wav	05
Ses05F_script01_3_M031	 And I got an ideal, watching them all go down.  Everything was being destroyed see and-	Ses05F-script01-04-01-3_M031.wav	04
Ses03F_script01_2_F015	 Don't, don't laugh at me, don't laugh at me.	Ses03F-script01-05-01-2_F015.wav	05
Ses01F_impro06_F004	 Thank you.	Ses01F-impro06-01-01-F004.wav	01
Ses05F_script01_3_M036	 And I felt what you said- ashamed somehow-because nobody had changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a whole lot of guys. and	Ses05F-script01-04-01-3_M036.wav	04
Ses01F_impro06_F019	 Yeah.	Ses01F-impro06-01-01-F019.wav	01
Ses01F_impro06_M006	 Mmhmm.	Ses01F-impro06-01-01-M006.wav	01
Ses01F_impro06_M008	 How long were you there for?	Ses01F-impro06-01-01-M008.wav	01
Ses03F_script02_1_M044	 About what I just said.	Ses03F-script02-01-01-1_M044.wav	01
Ses03F_script02_2_F000	 About what?	Ses03F-script02-01-01-2_F000.wav	01
Ses03F_script02_2_M001	 About what I was just saying.	Ses03F-script02-01-01-2_M001.wav	01
Ses01F_impro06_M012	 Is it a big cemetery?	Ses01F-impro06-01-01-M012.wav	01
Ses03F_script02_2_M016	 Wait a minute. I got it.	Ses03F-script02-01-01-2_M016.wav	01
Ses03F_script02_2_M042	 Are you still cold? Do you want to go home?	Ses03F-script02-01-01-2_M042.wav	01
Ses05F_script01_3_M009	 I- I -I have no imagination, that's all I know what to say, I-I'm embarrassing you. I I didn't want to tell you here.  I wanted it to be some place different, some place where we could be new to each other you know.	Ses05F-script01-07-01-3_M009.wav	07
Ses01F_impro06_F002	 No.	Ses01F-impro06-04-01-F002.wav	04
Ses03F_script02_1_F010	 Not particularly.	Ses03F-script02-04-01-1_F010.wav	04
Ses01F_impro06_F006	 I used to go to cemeteries a lot before she died.  I just, you know, I felt like they were urban oasis, you know, there is always this green in the city.	Ses01F-impro06-04-01-F006.wav	04
Ses05F_script02_1_F005	 yes.	Ses05F-script02-01-01-1_F005.wav	01
Ses03F_script02_2_F022	 I told myself finally, this is how happy I'm supposed to be.	Ses03F-script02-04-01-2_F022.wav	04
Ses05F_script02_1_F011	 Not particularly.	Ses05F-script02-01-01-1_F011.wav	01
Ses03F_script02_2_F025	 Hope for some things.	Ses03F-script02-04-01-2_F025.wav	04
Ses01F_impro06_F015	 couple hours.	Ses01F-impro06-04-01-F015.wav	04
Ses05F_script02_2_M016	 Wait a minute, I got it.	Ses05F-script02-01-01-2_M016.wav	01
Ses05F_script02_2_F013	 Augie, do you remember the first time we came to see it?  It was about four years ago right after we got married and we thought I was pregnant.	Ses05F-script02-04-01-2_F013.wav	04
Ses01F_impro06_F025	 But I mean she could, but it was- so it was kind of sitting at her feet holding her up and she had these poems she had memorized.  And I remember looking up, she had curly red hair and there was this palm tree right behind her and it was like a crown growing right out of her head.  It was cool.	Ses01F-impro06-04-01-F025.wav	04
Ses01F_impro06_M000	 I'm sorry, Joy.	Ses01F-impro06-04-01-M000.wav	04
Ses01F_impro06_M007	 Yeah.	Ses01F-impro06-04-01-M007.wav	04
Ses05F_script02_2_F025	 This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.	Ses05F-script02-04-01-2_F025.wav	04
Ses03F_script02_1_M000	 Hey, what time is it? They're supposed to run around midnight, right? God, this is great, isn't it?	Ses03F-script02-07-01-1_M000.wav	07
Ses03F_script02_1_M001	 Look at the night we got; couldn't be better.	Ses03F-script02-07-01-1_M001.wav	07
Ses01F_impro07_F002	 I'm really excited.  Yeah. I don't know how I'm going to pay for anything, but... I also- Yeah.  Loans, too, yeah. I applied, though, for a bunch of grants and scholarships so I'm still waiting to hear on that.	Ses01F-impro07-07-01-F002.wav	07
Ses01F_impro07_F003	 Oh- I know, I know, I know, I know.	Ses01F-impro07-07-01-F003.wav	07
Ses05F_script02_2_M032	 Maybe if you are with somebody else too?	Ses05F-script02-04-01-2_M032.wav	04
Ses03F_script02_1_M006	 Uh- you know, the flashlight. The silver one. There's only one, isn't there?	Ses03F-script02-07-01-1_M006.wav	07
Ses03F_script02_1_M009	 We should have brought our flashlight. I can't believe we forgot to bring it.	Ses03F-script02-07-01-1_M009.wav	07
Ses05F_script02_2_F005	 God damn it, Augie.  Why do you always ask things like that?  It's so insulting.	Ses05F-script02-05-01-2_F005.wav	05
Ses05F_script02_2_M025	 What.  Welcome to the human race.	Ses05F-script02-05-01-2_M025.wav	05
Ses05F_script02_1_M009	 Are you cold?  You want my jacket?  We should have bought a blanket.  Our blanket-.  This is great, isn't it?	Ses05F-script02-07-01-1_M009.wav	07
Ses01F_impro07_M004	 Oh.  Good, good.  That's awesome. Are you going to stay around here?  Or are you going to like get a different neighborhood- you going to move to a different neighborhood?	Ses01F-impro07-07-01-M004.wav	07
Ses05F_script02_1_M012	 you want my jacket?	Ses05F-script02-07-01-1_M012.wav	07
Ses05F_script02_1_M014	 Right.	Ses05F-script02-07-01-1_M014.wav	07
Ses05F_script02_1_M018	 Honey, this is a natural phenomenon. I mean,  It happens like once a year.  It's a great opportunity.	Ses05F-script02-07-01-1_M018.wav	07
Ses05F_script02_1_M020	 Yeah but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives, all that flopping around is laying eggs or what you- mating or spawning or something like that.	Ses05F-script02-07-01-1_M020.wav	07
Ses01F_impro07_M014	 Teacher. Mrs. Nash, I have a question.	Ses01F-impro07-07-01-M014.wav	07
Ses01F_impro07_M015	 You have to get married.  Well you are married to Chuck.  You're Mrs. Nash.  Not to be confused with Mrs. Dash which is the popular seasoning.	Ses01F-impro07-07-01-M015.wav	07
Ses05F_script02_1_M031	 Somewhere out there, is a giant mass of silver fish all swimming in this direction.  They don't know why and we don't know why. They didn't get an invitation.  And it wasn't a vote- it wasn't a decision.  And nobody sent them a map or anything like that.	Ses05F-script02-07-01-1_M031.wav	07
Ses01F_script01_1_M000	 He saw it.	Ses01F-script01-01-01-1_M000.wav	01
Ses03F_script03_2_M011	 I'll have a little, I think.	Ses03F-script03-01-01-2_M011.wav	01
Ses03F_script03_1_F015	 Well, what if happens if one of us is to die? Does the one that's left still laugh?	Ses03F-script03-04-01-1_F015.wav	04
Ses05F_script03_1_F015	 Well, what if-what happens when our love-	Ses05F-script03-01-01-1_F015.wav	01
Ses01F_script01_1_M025	 And then we'll thrash it out with father.  Okay Mom?  Don't avoid me.	Ses01F-script01-01-01-1_M025.wav	01
Ses01F_script01_1_M034	 I'll get out.  I'll get married and I'll move somewhere else, maybe New York.	Ses01F-script01-01-01-1_M034.wav	01
Ses03F_script03_2_F035	 Turn it on.	Ses03F-script03-05-01-2_F035.wav	05
Ses05F_script03_2_F005	 And what of it?	Ses05F-script03-01-01-2_F005.wav	01
Ses01F_script01_2_M008	 How do you know why she waited?	Ses01F-script01-01-01-2_M008.wav	01
Ses05F_script03_2_F011	 Well, it seems silly to go on and on in such a thing.	Ses05F-script03-01-01-2_F011.wav	01
Ses03F_script03_2_M000	 As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.	Ses03F-script03-05-01-2_M000.wav	05
Ses01F_script01_3_F002	 [BREATHING] You know, it's lovely here.  The air is sweet.	Ses01F-script01-01-01-3_F002.wav	01
Ses01F_script01_3_F004	 For one thing, your mother much as told me to go.	Ses01F-script01-01-01-3_F004.wav	01
Ses01F_script01_3_F009	 I, umm. I guess, I guess that's kind of why I came.	Ses01F-script01-01-01-3_F009.wav	01
Ses01F_script01_3_F014	 Chris, I've been ready a long, long, time.	Ses01F-script01-01-01-3_F014.wav	01
Ses01F_script01_3_F015	 I almost got married two years ago.	Ses01F-script01-01-01-3_F015.wav	01
Ses01F_script01_3_F016	 You started to write me.	Ses01F-script01-01-01-3_F016.wav	01
Ses05F_script03_2_F021	 I don't care if they bark and roll around like hoops, okay.	Ses05F-script03-05-01-2_F021.wav	05
Ses03F_script03_2_M027	 I imagine that you let him kiss you quite a bit more then, didn't you?	Ses03F-script03-05-01-2_M027.wav	05
Ses01F_script01_3_F029	 How many?	Ses01F-script01-01-01-3_F029.wav	01
Ses03F_script03_2_M028	 You had a riotous-must have had a riotous time. No restraint at all. Very enjoyable. You never had much anyhow.	Ses03F-script03-05-01-2_M028.wav	05
Ses05F_script03_2_F031	 They're away in Tunis.	Ses05F-script03-05-01-2_F031.wav	05
Ses03F_script03_2_M038	 Turn it off.	Ses03F-script03-05-01-2_M038.wav	05
Ses05F_script03_2_F036	 I- I hate you.	Ses05F-script03-05-01-2_F036.wav	05
Ses01F_script01_3_M026	 Well I lost them.	Ses01F-script01-04-01-3_M026.wav	04
Ses01F_script01_3_M027	 Pretty much all.	Ses01F-script01-04-01-3_M027.wav	04
Ses05F_script03_2_M013	 You needn't be so grand simply because you don't happen to want any at the moment.	Ses05F-script03-05-01-2_M013.wav	05
Ses05F_script03_2_M014	 Really, Amanda.	Ses05F-script03-05-01-2_M014.wav	05
Ses01F_script01_3_M030	 They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that, exactly.  Just a little more selfish and they would all be here today.	Ses01F-script01-04-01-3_M030.wav	04
Ses05F_script03_2_M019	 It's a pity you didn't take a little more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.	Ses05F-script03-05-01-2_M019.wav	05
Ses05F_script03_2_M024	 Did you see much of Peter Burden after the divorce?	Ses05F-script03-05-01-2_M024.wav	05
Ses01F_script01_3_M036	 And I didn't want any of it. I guess that included you.	Ses01F-script01-04-01-3_M036.wav	04
Ses03M_impro01_F003	 No.  You filled out the back part.  You were supposed to fill out the front portion only.	Ses03M-impro01-01-01-F003.wav	01
Ses03M_impro01_F025	 This entire time you're fighting with me sir, you could've finished the form and already been half way-- No.  Get out.	Ses03M-impro01-05-01-F025.wav	05
Ses01F_script01_1_F041	 All right.  But you don't want to think like that because what the hell are we working for, Chris?  It's all for you.  This whole shooting match is for you.	Ses01F-script01-05-01-1_F041.wav	05
Ses05F_script03_2_M040	 Amanda-- Listen- Listen-	Ses05F-script03-05-01-2_M040.wav	05
Ses01F_script01_1_M019	 You know sometimes you infuriate me.  you know that?  Isn't it your business if I tell father and he throws a fit about it?  God, you have such a talent for ignoring things.	Ses01F-script01-05-01-1_M019.wav	05
Ses01F_script01_2_F009	 Nobody in this house dares take away her faith, Joe.  You know strangers might, but not his father, not his brother.	Ses01F-script01-05-01-2_F009.wav	05
Ses05F_script03_1_M000	 Good God.	Ses05F-script03-07-01-1_M000.wav	07
Ses03M_impro02_F013	 Do this whole thing by myself?	Ses03M-impro02-04-01-F013.wav	04
Ses01F_script01_2_F013	 Just believe with me, Joe. Only last week a man came back in Detroit missing longer than Larry.  Believe with me. You, above all, have got to believe. Just believe.	Ses01F-script01-05-01-2_F013.wav	05
Ses01F_script01_2_M017	 What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you, Kate?	Ses01F-script01-05-01-2_M017.wav	05
Ses03M_impro02_F016	 I can't do this.	Ses03M-impro02-04-01-F016.wav	04
Ses01F_script02_1_F004	 That's not your flashlight.	Ses01F-script02-01-01-1_F004.wav	01
Ses03M_impro02_F017	 I'm sick of being strong-- --for us.	Ses03M-impro02-04-01-F017.wav	04
Ses05F_script03_1_M016	 No, that fire will fade along with our passion.	Ses05F-script03-07-01-1_M016.wav	07
Ses01F_script02_1_F024	 That's the wind.	Ses01F-script02-01-01-1_F024.wav	01
Ses01F_script02_1_F025	 About what?	Ses01F-script02-01-01-1_F025.wav	01
Ses05F_script03_1_M018	 Yes, yes, with all his might.	Ses05F-script03-07-01-1_M018.wav	07
Ses01F_script02_1_M008	 Whose is it?	Ses01F-script02-01-01-1_M008.wav	01
Ses01F_script02_1_M009	 Oh...well. Yeah, of course.	Ses01F-script02-01-01-1_M009.wav	01
Ses01F_script02_1_M010	 No.	Ses01F-script02-01-01-1_M010.wav	01
Ses05F_script03_1_M020	 no, So is everyone else in the long run.  Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and --	Ses05F-script03-07-01-1_M020.wav	07
Ses05F_script03_1_M021	 enjoy the party as long as we can like very little quite idiotic schoolchildren. [garbage] Let's savor the delight of the moment.	Ses05F-script03-07-01-1_M021.wav	07
Ses03M_impro02_F033	 I need you here.  Anna needs you.	Ses03M-impro02-04-01-F033.wav	04
Ses03M_impro02_F034	 yeah.	Ses03M-impro02-04-01-F034.wav	04
Ses01F_script02_1_M021	 Wait, that's my point, too.	Ses01F-script02-01-01-1_M021.wav	01
Ses01F_script02_1_M023	 Why not?	Ses01F-script02-01-01-1_M023.wav	01
Ses01F_script02_1_M024	 Honey, this is like a natural phenomenon. I mean... People in Kansas would have to get plane reservations and get hotel rooms to see this.  It's just forty minutes away for us; it's too good to pass up.	Ses01F-script02-01-01-1_M024.wav	01
Ses03M_impro02_M002	 Uh, -Um	Ses03M-impro02-04-01-M002.wav	04
Ses03M_impro02_M003	 they need me out there sooner than I thought	Ses03M-impro02-04-01-M003.wav	04
Ses03M_impro02_M004	 They want to deploy me next week.	Ses03M-impro02-04-01-M004.wav	04
Ses03M_impro02_M005	 For--	Ses03M-impro02-04-01-M005.wav	04
Ses01F_script02_1_M032	 And last year, I remember distinctly you said, you were so excited to get here that you don't remember you stubbed your toe until we were in the car.	Ses01F-script02-01-01-1_M032.wav	01
Ses05M_impro01_F002	 Right, but this is the wrong form.  Somebody gave you the wrong form.	Ses05M-impro01-01-01-F002.wav	01
Ses05M_impro01_F003	 Yeah.  So, I can't -- I can't do anything-	Ses05M-impro01-01-01-F003.wav	01
Ses03M_impro02_M025	 They want me there two years but I could probably get	Ses03M-impro02-04-01-M025.wav	04
Ses05M_impro01_F021	 I'm gonna- I'm gonna bring security over and have them escort you out.	Ses05M-impro01-05-01-F021.wav	05
Ses01F_script02_2_F026	 No.	Ses01F-script02-01-01-2_F026.wav	01
Ses01F_script02_2_M006	 Carla, can I ask you something?  Now, don't take this the wrong way, but are you on your period?	Ses01F-script02-01-01-2_M006.wav	01
Ses05M_impro02_F023	 okay.	Ses05M-impro02-04-01-F023.wav	04
Ses05M_impro02_F024	 [GARBAGE]	Ses05M-impro02-04-01-F024.wav	04
Ses05M_impro02_M000	 Sweetheart, I've got to tell you something.  I just got a call.  I'm going to Iraq.	Ses05M-impro02-04-01-M000.wav	04
Ses05M_impro02_M001	 I know it's really crappy timing, but I don't have a choice.	Ses05M-impro02-04-01-M001.wav	04
Ses03M_impro03_M038	 I'm still working at my parents' restaurant. Busing tables.	Ses03M-impro03-01-01-M038.wav	01
Ses05M_impro02_M010	 I know.	Ses05M-impro02-04-01-M010.wav	04
Ses05M_impro02_M019	 I'm gonna be in Bagdad, just doing security.	Ses05M-impro02-04-01-M019.wav	04
Ses01F_script02_2_F022	 I'd rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for some things.	Ses01F-script02-04-01-2_F022.wav	04
Ses05M_impro02_M024	 No.  It doesn't.  And you can't think like that.	Ses05M-impro02-04-01-M024.wav	04
Ses05M_impro02_M027	 I'll miss you, baby.	Ses05M-impro02-04-01-M027.wav	04
Ses05M_impro02_M028	 All- I'll write you everyday, all the time.  And I'll send you pictures and you send me pictures. I know We've got email out there.  We've got email and I can see stuff and you can send me stuff all the time.  Okay?	Ses05M-impro02-04-01-M028.wav	04
Ses03M_impro03_M013	 Come on. It was her birthday.	Ses03M-impro03-07-01-M013.wav	07
Ses01F_script02_2_M037	 Maybe if you were with someone else, too.	Ses01F-script02-04-01-2_M037.wav	04
Ses03M_impro03_M035	 I'm so excited.  It's going to be great.	Ses03M-impro03-07-01-M035.wav	07
Ses01F_script02_1_F006	 You keep saying my flashlight like it's just yours.	Ses01F-script02-05-01-1_F006.wav	05
Ses03M_impro04_F015	 Well, I'm moving up.  I mean it could be...	Ses03M-impro04-01-01-F015.wav	01
Ses05M_impro03_F002	 When?	Ses05M-impro03-07-01-F002.wav	07
Ses03M_impro04_F030	 But you got to be real about it.  You have to...	Ses03M-impro04-01-01-F030.wav	01
Ses01F_script02_1_M016	 God, I'm so excited, I'm like a kid.  I can't believe I got out of the house with my fly zipped up.	Ses01F-script02-07-01-1_M016.wav	07
Ses03M_impro04_M024	 Yeah.  It's alright.  But--	Ses03M-impro04-01-01-M024.wav	01
Ses03M_impro04_M038	 Same difference.	Ses03M-impro04-01-01-M038.wav	01
Ses03M_impro04_M026	 No.	Ses03M-impro04-04-01-M026.wav	04
Ses05M_impro04_F003	 What have you been trying?	Ses05M-impro04-01-01-F003.wav	01
Ses05M_impro04_F004	 Right.	Ses05M-impro04-01-01-F004.wav	01
Ses01F_script03_2_M018	 Well as a matter of fact, yes, that's perfectly true.	Ses01F-script03-01-01-2_M018.wav	01
Ses01F_script03_2_M019	 Yes it is.	Ses01F-script03-01-01-2_M019.wav	01
Ses01F_script03_2_M031	 This is no time of year for Tunis.	Ses01F-script03-01-01-2_M031.wav	01
Ses03M_impro05a_F007	 You're at me and I'm going to try to help you out sir but you just have to cooperate with me--	Ses03M-impro05a-01-01-F007.wav	01
Ses03M_impro05a_F008	 How many pieces of luggage do you have checked in?	Ses03M-impro05a-01-01-F008.wav	01
Ses01F_script03_2_F015	 No.  I am just making myself fascinating for you.	Ses01F-script03-05-01-2_F015.wav	05
Ses03M_impro05a_F014	 Yes--it is	Ses03M-impro05a-01-01-F014.wav	01
Ses01F_script03_2_F017	 No it isn't.	Ses01F-script03-05-01-2_F017.wav	05
Ses03M_impro05a_F021	 Please, please	Ses03M-impro05a-01-01-F021.wav	01
Ses05M_impro04_F008	 L.A. is really hard.  I mean, have you tried like just going into a bar a couple of times to make friends with people who work there? and	Ses05M-impro04-01-01-F008.wav	01
Ses01F_script03_2_F022	 Yes I did, quite a lot.	Ses01F-script03-05-01-2_F022.wav	05
Ses05M_impro04_F013	 Maybe [garbage].	Ses05M-impro04-01-01-F013.wav	01
Ses05M_impro04_F015	 I don't know.  I'm I'm just trying --	Ses05M-impro04-01-01-F015.wav	01
Ses05M_impro04_F016	 Are you getting defensive?	Ses05M-impro04-01-01-F016.wav	01
Ses03M_impro05a_M002	 I had eight hundred pounds of luggage.	Ses03M-impro05a-05-01-M002.wav	05
Ses05M_impro04_F022	 Not- Not selling pot, right?	Ses05M-impro04-01-01-F022.wav	01
Ses01F_script03_2_F038	 This is the end.  Do you hear me?  Finally and forever.	Ses01F-script03-05-01-2_F038.wav	05
Ses01F_script03_2_M020	 Oh really.  It's a pity you didn't have any brandy, it would have made you a little less disagreeable.	Ses01F-script03-05-01-2_M020.wav	05
Ses01F_script03_2_M021	 Snap, snap, snap.  You know you are like a little adder.	Ses01F-script03-05-01-2_M021.wav	05
Ses01F_script03_2_M022	 Nonsense.  They have a bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap. They snap.	Ses01F-script03-05-01-2_M022.wav	05
Ses03M_impro05a_M016	 Oh, oh, that's a good deduction.	Ses03M-impro05a-05-01-M016.wav	05
Ses03M_impro05a_M021	 Don't yell at me.	Ses03M-impro05a-05-01-M021.wav	05
Ses05M_impro04_F035	 Well, um, is that kinda like the side of you that you let people see when you go into these job interviews?	Ses05M-impro04-01-01-F035.wav	01
Ses01F_script03_2_M026	 I think I mentioned once before that I've had three minute liquor glasses the whole evening long.  A child of two cannot get drunk on that.	Ses01F-script03-05-01-2_M026.wav	05
Ses03M_impro05a_M024	 What?  Are you kidding me?	Ses03M-impro05a-05-01-M024.wav	05
Ses01F_script03_2_M029	 Look, you better turn that off. I don't want to wake up the people upstairs.	Ses01F-script03-05-01-2_M029.wav	05
Ses03M_impro05a_M026	 You're the manager? You don't know where you work for, you don't know where you're at and you're the manager?	Ses03M-impro05a-05-01-M026.wav	05
Ses05M_impro04_M008	 You plan on being there forever? I mean, Like, what do you --	Ses05M-impro04-01-01-M008.wav	01
Ses05M_impro04_M009	 yeah.	Ses05M-impro04-01-01-M009.wav	01
Ses01F_script03_2_M035	 Amanda, listen, listen.	Ses01F-script03-05-01-2_M035.wav	05
Ses05M_impro05_F003	 Um, okay.  Well, you can fly- file a claim.  Where were you coming from?	Ses05M-impro05-01-01-F003.wav	01
Ses01F_script03_2_M037	 You are a vile, ill-tempered, loose living, wicked little beast and I never want to see you again as long as I live.	Ses01F-script03-05-01-2_M037.wav	05
Ses05M_impro05_F010	 No, you have to buy it now.  It's like thirty dollar extra.	Ses05M-impro05-01-01-F010.wav	01
Ses03M_impro05b_F007	 Well sir, if if...what I believe has happened is most of the flight was left--	Ses03M-impro05b-01-01-F007.wav	01
Ses01F_script03_1_F024	 Oh Charles, that was his name.  He did wiggle so beautifully.	Ses01F-script03-07-01-1_F024.wav	07
Ses01F_script03_1_M005	 I don't care then.	Ses01F-script03-07-01-1_M005.wav	07
Ses05M_impro05_F013	 Chances are it's probably just you know -- taking time being um- unloaded from the airplane.	Ses05M-impro05-01-01-F013.wav	01
Ses03M_impro05b_F011	 Well, we can give you um- hotel lodging for a night if that--	Ses03M-impro05b-01-01-F011.wav	01
Ses01M_impro01_F024	 Uh huh.  I didn't come here get in yelling match either.	Ses01M-impro01-01-01-F024.wav	01
Ses05M_impro05_F015	 wow.	Ses05M-impro05-01-01-F015.wav	01
Ses03M_impro05b_F018	 What is your business?	Ses03M-impro05b-01-01-F018.wav	01
Ses05M_impro05_M000	 Hi. Um-  My luggage didn't come out of the conveyor thingy.	Ses05M-impro05-01-01-M000.wav	01
Ses01M_impro01_F008	 It's really simple if you have a problem with it... Maybe you should--	Ses01M-impro01-05-01-F008.wav	05
Ses03M_impro05b_F021	 Well, the entire flight, sir, the luggage was placed on another plane that never actually left Baltimore.	Ses03M-impro05b-01-01-F021.wav	01
Ses03M_impro05b_F022	 Uh no I'm not.	Ses03M-impro05b-01-01-F022.wav	01

Ses04F_script01_2_F001	 It's been three years.  Why all of a sudden?	Ses04F-script01-05-01-2_F001.wav	05
Ses02F_script01_1_M027	 Well, if she does, then that's the end of it.  But from her letters, I think she's forgotten him.  I'll find out.  And then we'll thrash it out with Dad, right?  Mom, don't avoid me.	Ses02F-script01-04-01-1_M027.wav	04
Ses02F_script01_3_F009	 from her point of view, why else would I come?	Ses02F-script01-04-01-3_F009.wav	04
Ses02F_script01_3_F026	 You still feel that way?	Ses02F-script01-04-01-3_F026.wav	04
Ses02F_script01_3_M020	 No.  Nothing like that.	Ses02F-script01-04-01-3_M020.wav	04
Ses02F_script01_3_M023	 It's all mixed up with so many other things.  You remember overseas, I was in command of a company?	Ses02F-script01-04-01-3_M023.wav	04
Ses02F_script01_3_M027	 For instance, one time, it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks.  I put them in pocket.  It's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had.	Ses02F-script01-04-01-3_M027.wav	04
Ses02F_script01_3_M028	 They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today.	Ses02F-script01-04-01-3_M028.wav	04
Ses02F_script01_3_M032	 And I felt what you said, ashamed somehow 'cause nobody was changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book, drive the new car, see the new refrigerator.	Ses02F-script01-04-01-3_M032.wav	04
Ses04F_script02_2_F019	 We thought I was pregnant and we had a bottle of champagne but no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  So we took off our shoes	Ses04F-script02-04-01-2_F019.wav	04
Ses02F_script01_1_F038	 Must you be inspired?	Ses02F-script01-05-01-1_F038.wav	05
Ses02F_script01_1_M011	 Why shouldn't he dream of him and walk the nights waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore?  That we haven't had hope for years now?	Ses02F-script01-05-01-1_M011.wav	05
Ses04F_script02_2_M041	 No, I know but still.  I know I don't make you happy.	Ses04F-script02-04-01-2_M041.wav	04
Ses04F_script02_1_F007	 It's after eleven let's go home.	Ses04F-script02-05-01-1_F007.wav	05
Ses04F_script02_1_F008	 There is no point in coming down here.	Ses04F-script02-05-01-1_F008.wav	05
Ses04F_script02_1_F012	 I just don't.  It's stupid.	Ses04F-script02-05-01-1_F012.wav	05
Ses02F_script01_1_M037	 The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.	Ses02F-script01-05-01-1_M037.wav	05
Ses04F_script02_1_F013	 Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach, flop around, and then swim away and then they die.	Ses04F-script02-05-01-1_F013.wav	05
Ses04F_script02_1_F014	 What are you so excited about?  This isn't a moon landing we're talking about.  It's fish.  It's fish nobody even eats.	Ses04F-script02-05-01-1_F014.wav	05
Ses04F_script02_1_F019	 We didn't see them the first time either.	Ses04F-script02-05-01-1_F019.wav	05
Ses04F_script02_1_M031	 We just weren't in a good spot.  This is a much better spot.	Ses04F-script02-05-01-1_M031.wav	05
Ses02F_script02_1_F001	 What flashlight?	Ses02F-script02-01-01-1_F001.wav	01
Ses04F_script02_2_F009	 For heaven's sake, grow up we are not going to see the Grunions.	Ses04F-script02-05-01-2_F009.wav	05
Ses04F_script02_2_F010	 We never do.  Do we have we ever?	Ses04F-script02-05-01-2_F010.wav	05
Ses02F_script02_1_M017	 Do you want my jacket?	Ses02F-script02-01-01-1_M017.wav	01
Ses02F_script02_1_M019	 Right.	Ses02F-script02-01-01-1_M019.wav	01
Ses02F_script02_1_M020	 That's my point too.	Ses02F-script02-01-01-1_M020.wav	01
Ses02F_script02_1_M021	 No. No. That's not my point.  The point is there's no point in coming down if we just leave.  Don't you want to see it?	Ses02F-script02-01-01-1_M021.wav	01
Ses04F_script02_1_M002	 Is that, is that-that's just foam isn't it?  I can't even tell	Ses04F-script02-07-01-1_M002.wav	07
Ses02F_script02_2_F000	 About what?	Ses02F-script02-01-01-2_F000.wav	01
Ses02F_script02_2_M002	 It certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.	Ses02F-script02-01-01-2_M002.wav	01
Ses02F_script02_2_M016	 You said, "Hey the grunion are running tonight."  I said, "Great, let's go.  I feel lucky."	Ses02F-script02-01-01-2_M016.wav	01
Ses02F_script02_2_M018	 Wait a minute.  I've got it.	Ses02F-script02-01-01-2_M018.wav	01
Ses02F_script02_2_M023	 Take off our shoes?	Ses02F-script02-01-01-2_M023.wav	01
Ses02F_script02_2_M033	 Yes, it is.	Ses02F-script02-01-01-2_M033.wav	01
Ses04F_script03_2_F012	 It's become a habit with you.	Ses04F-script03-05-01-2_F012.wav	05
Ses04F_script03_2_F013	 Oh, don't be so stupid.	Ses04F-script03-05-01-2_F013.wav	05
Ses02F_script02_2_F022	 No.	Ses02F-script02-04-01-2_F022.wav	04
Ses04F_script03_2_F019	 It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.	Ses04F-script03-05-01-2_F019.wav	05
Ses04F_script03_2_F020	 Adders don't snap they sting.	Ses04F-script03-05-01-2_F020.wav	05
Ses02F_script02_2_F033	 I know that, Augie.  Really, I do.	Ses02F-script02-04-01-2_F033.wav	04
Ses02F_script02_2_F038	 You're the one who probably wishes you were with someone else.  Someone who--you'd rather enjoy yourself and didn't take everything so hard.	Ses02F-script02-04-01-2_F038.wav	04
Ses02F_script02_2_M031	 No, Carla, I'm just like you.  I thought it was gonna be all peaches and roses and sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'll have three fat rosy kids and ha, ha, baby, the joke's on us	Ses02F-script02-04-01-2_M031.wav	04
Ses02F_script02_2_M038	 No, I know.  But still.  I know I don't make you happy.	Ses02F-script02-04-01-2_M038.wav	04
Ses02F_script02_2_M029	 Well, welcome to the human race.  Do you think this is what I had in mind when I proposed?  That four years down the road, we'd be at the beach yelling at each other over fish?	Ses02F-script02-05-01-2_M029.wav	05
Ses02F_script02_1_M006	 How you doing?  Aw, you know what I forgot?  I forgot to bring my flashlight.  Oh, how could I be so stupid?  I should've brought my flashlight.	Ses02F-script02-07-01-1_M006.wav	07
Ses02F_script02_1_M014	 This is great, isn't it?  A six pack would be just the ticket right now.	Ses02F-script02-07-01-1_M014.wav	07
Ses02F_script02_1_M025	 Yeah, but that moment on the beach, is the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping is laying eggs or what do you--spawning or mating.  I mean,	Ses02F-script02-07-01-1_M025.wav	07
Ses04F_script03_2_M007	 What about me?	Ses04F-script03-05-01-2_M007.wav	05
Ses02F_script02_1_M028	 Alright.  But it's fish that do something that none of the other fish do.  Like the swallows returning to Capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs.	Ses02F-script02-07-01-1_M028.wav	07
Ses02F_script02_1_M036	 Oh man, this is great, isn't it?  I wouldn't miss this for anything.  Here, think about this, all right, I know you're not interested, but think about this.	Ses02F-script02-07-01-1_M036.wav	07
Ses02F_script02_1_M042	 Ah, God, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  Look, all my hairs are popped up.	Ses02F-script02-07-01-1_M042.wav	07
Ses04F_script03_2_M035	 This is no time of year for Tunis.	Ses04F-script03-05-01-2_M035.wav	05
Ses02F_script03_1_F027	 That was the first time you ever hit me.	Ses02F-script03-01-01-1_F027.wav	01
Ses02F_script03_1_M018	 Depends on how well we've played.	Ses02F-script03-01-01-1_M018.wav	01
Ses04M_impro01_M003	 Yes, I do.	Ses04M-impro01-01-01-M003.wav	01
Ses02F_script03_2_F012	 Well, it's become a habit with you.	Ses02F-script03-01-01-2_F012.wav	01
Ses02F_script03_2_M000	 As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.	Ses02F-script03-01-01-2_M000.wav	01
Ses04M_impro02_F020	 When do you leave?	Ses04M-impro02-04-01-F020.wav	04
Ses02F_script03_2_F025	 You're quite insufferable	Ses02F-script03-05-01-2_F025.wav	05
Ses02F_script03_2_F031	 Why?	Ses02F-script03-05-01-2_F031.wav	05
Ses04M_impro03_F005	 Oh, my God.  How long have you been planning on doing this?	Ses04M-impro03-07-01-F005.wav	07
Ses04M_impro03_F012	 Well I don't know.  Throwing it out there.	Ses04M-impro03-07-01-F012.wav	07
Ses04M_impro03_F015	 It's so exciting.  What's the ring look like?	Ses04M-impro03-07-01-F015.wav	07
Ses04M_impro03_F016	 Big and shiny.  You're such a guy. [LAUGHTER]	Ses04M-impro03-07-01-F016.wav	07
Ses02F_script03_2_M013	 You needn't be so grand, just because you don't happen to want any yourself at the moment.	Ses02F-script03-05-01-2_M013.wav	05
Ses02F_script03_2_M030	 We could get a good debate going about this, don't you think?  Intemperate tots.	Ses02F-script03-05-01-2_M030.wav	05
Ses02F_script03_2_M036	 I'll do no such thing.	Ses02F-script03-05-01-2_M036.wav	05
Ses02F_script03_2_M038	 Turn it off.	Ses02F-script03-05-01-2_M038.wav	05
Ses02F_script03_2_M044	 Shut up. Shut up.	Ses02F-script03-05-01-2_M044.wav	05
Ses04M_impro04_F003	 Right, but you have -- I mean, you have to keep on them.  You have to keep calling and reminding them that you're still looking and	Ses04M-impro04-01-01-F003.wav	01
Ses02F_script03_1_M020	 No. No, it isn't.  Death is very laughable.  Such a cunning little mystery.  All done with mirrors.	Ses02F-script03-07-01-1_M020.wav	07
Ses04M_impro04_F012	 Well that sounds like your fault.	Ses04M-impro04-01-01-F012.wav	01
Ses02F_script03_1_M032	 Oh, I'll never forget his face.	Ses02F-script03-07-01-1_M032.wav	07
Ses02M_impro01_F001	 Sure, um	Ses02M-impro01-01-01-F001.wav	01
Ses02M_impro01_F002	 do you have two forms of ID with you?	Ses02M-impro01-01-01-F002.wav	01
Ses04M_impro04_M020	 Well, I mean, it makes sense, doesn't it, hmm?	Ses04M-impro04-01-01-M020.wav	01
Ses02M_impro01_M002	 get my new license.	Ses02M-impro01-01-01-M002.wav	01
Ses04M_impro05_F008	 refund--coverage of the bag that was lost. yes	Ses04M-impro05-01-01-F008.wav	01
Ses02M_impro01_M007	 What? I- You telling me I waited in that huge line to go and sit down and get my number called, like after	Ses02M-impro01-05-01-M007.wav	05
Ses04M_impro05_F037	 I know. I understand it's personal-- It's personal to you. I get that.	Ses04M-impro05-01-01-F037.wav	01
Ses04M_impro05_M017	 No.  No.  No.  What I need you to do -- I need you to write checks for -- I need you to write three of them. That'll be satisfactory.	Ses04M-impro05-05-01-M017.wav	05
Ses02M_impro02_F009	 Well, just promise me that you going to be safe.	Ses02M-impro02-04-01-F009.wav	04
Ses02M_impro02_F010	 I mean can't they put you in like, you know kitchen work or something where you won't get	Ses02M-impro02-04-01-F010.wav	04
Ses04M_impro05_M039	 I'm already calm. Okay, I'm calm. I'm calm.	Ses04M-impro05-05-01-M039.wav	05
Ses02M_impro02_F013	 Our baby needs a dad; you can't leave. Okay, you can't disappear.	Ses02M-impro02-04-01-F013.wav	04
Ses02M_impro02_M000	 I know, I know. I don't want to go either baby. I love you know. And I'm going to miss you a lot.	Ses02M-impro02-04-01-M000.wav	04
Ses02M_impro02_M001	 You won't be. I'll be back; I'll be back before you know it. All right, and	Ses02M-impro02-04-01-M001.wav	04
Ses02M_impro02_M002	 and	Ses02M-impro02-04-01-M002.wav	04
Ses04M_impro06_F012	 It'll get better.  I know it doesn't help, but it will get better and you will remember all of the good things that you guys had; all of the memories that you have with him that were happy and you'll be grateful for those.	Ses04M-impro06-04-01-F012.wav	04
Ses02M_impro03_F004	 Did she say yes?	Ses02M-impro03-07-01-F004.wav	07
Ses02M_impro03_F005	 That's like the most definitive.	Ses02M-impro03-07-01-F005.wav	07
Ses04M_impro06_M002	 a major part of your life and then they're gone.  And I don't know.  That's not really -- it's never really happened to me before.	Ses04M-impro06-04-01-M002.wav	04
Ses04M_impro06_M008	 [BREATHING] I mean, there's nothing really to talk about.  He's gone and I'll never see him again.	Ses04M-impro06-04-01-M008.wav	04
Ses02M_impro03_M001	 Well, I finally did it	Ses02M-impro03-07-01-M001.wav	07
Ses04M_impro06_M011	 This is just -- this is a terrible life.  I just don't understand.	Ses04M-impro06-04-01-M011.wav	04
Ses02M_impro03_M018	 No, but it was good.	Ses02M-impro03-07-01-M018.wav	07
Ses02M_impro04_F001	 You've been doing a lot of work for it, right?	Ses02M-impro04-01-01-F001.wav	01
Ses02M_impro04_F010	 That's- I mean. There are more factors then just whether you're good or not, you know what I mean like	Ses02M-impro04-01-01-F010.wav	01
Ses02M_impro04_F014	 You know and the fact you still here and still cooking, like it's good that you're thinking about it, that you're reconsidering.	Ses02M-impro04-01-01-F014.wav	01
Ses04M_impro07_M043	 Well I need to defend myself from	Ses04M-impro07-01-01-M043.wav	01
Ses02M_impro04_F009	 I'm sorry.	Ses02M-impro04-04-01-F009.wav	04
Ses02M_impro05_F001	 Oh, did you check? Did you make sure as it went around the second time that it-	Ses02M-impro05-01-01-F001.wav	01
Ses04M_impro07_F012	 I know.  You're going to be so close.	Ses04M-impro07-07-01-F012.wav	07
Ses02M_impro05_F008	 I- I- I understand, but um.	Ses02M-impro05-01-01-F008.wav	01
Ses04M_impro07_M015	 And, uh, it's just really exciting.  I- You know, I'm -- just I want to- I want to share this special happy moment with you. It's awesome	Ses04M-impro07-07-01-M015.wav	07
Ses02M_impro05_F020	 all right, We've already checked back here for your baggage	Ses02M-impro05-01-01-F020.wav	01
Ses02M_impro05_F025	 Well because lots of people get their baggage lost and we don't want to have false claims or anything like that so we have	Ses02M-impro05-01-01-F025.wav	01
Ses04M_impro08_M012	 What I can do for you is give you a hundred dollars right now and fill out complaint form	Ses04M-impro08-01-01-M012.wav	01
Ses02M_impro06_F004	 It's going to be so rough, I'm sorry.	Ses02M-impro06-04-01-F004.wav	04
Ses04M_impro08_M021	 Sure.	Ses04M-impro08-01-01-M021.wav	01
Ses02M_impro06_F007	 Yeah	Ses02M-impro06-04-01-F007.wav	04
Ses02M_impro06_F008	 Yes. Well, at least you have a lot of good memories.	Ses02M-impro06-04-01-F008.wav	04
Ses02M_impro06_F009	 She really cared about you, you know.	Ses02M-impro06-04-01-F009.wav	04
Ses04M_script01_1_F000	 What's he going to say?  Maybe we ought to tell him before he sees it.	Ses04M-script01-01-01-1_F000.wav	01
Ses02M_impro06_M008	 It's just that- I don't know, it's sort it's sort- of a weird thing you know	Ses02M-impro06-04-01-M008.wav	04
Ses02M_impro06_M010	 She was [garbage]	Ses02M-impro06-04-01-M010.wav	04
Ses02M_impro06_M011	 Yes, I mean she cared about all of us. She was great	Ses02M-impro06-04-01-M011.wav	04
Ses04M_script01_2_F007	 Now listen, kid. Now, listen.	Ses04M-script01-01-01-2_F007.wav	01
Ses02M_impro06_M014	 We were all going take a trip to Europe you know.	Ses02M-impro06-04-01-M014.wav	04
Ses04M_script01_2_M006	 Well so what?	Ses04M-script01-01-01-2_M006.wav	01
Ses02M_impro06_M017	 just makes it that much harder to deal 'cause as much as you want to, you know, make her better, see her not in any pain, it's like, just I don't know, just has a mind of its own.	Ses02M-impro06-04-01-M017.wav	04
Ses04M_script01_3_M026	 Just about all.	Ses04M-script01-04-01-3_M026.wav	04
Ses04M_script01_3_M027	 It takes a little time to toss that off because they weren't just men.	Ses04M-script01-04-01-3_M027.wav	04
Ses02M_impro07_F004	 [LAUGHTER] It's gotta be it, like-	Ses02M-impro07-07-01-F004.wav	07
Ses04M_script01_3_M032	 There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them was some sort of bus accident.  Then I went to work for dad and that whole rat race again.  I felt, what you said, ashamed somehow	Ses04M-script01-04-01-3_M032.wav	04
Ses02M_impro07_F011	 So can we hang out?	Ses02M-impro07-07-01-F011.wav	07
Ses04M_script01_1_F011	 You can't say that to him.	Ses04M-script01-05-01-1_F011.wav	05
Ses04M_script01_1_F021	 I ignore what I got to ignore.  The girl is Larry's girl.	Ses04M-script01-05-01-1_F021.wav	05
Ses04M_script01_1_F022	 From father's point of view, he's not dead.  And you have no right to take his girl.	Ses04M-script01-05-01-1_F022.wav	05
Ses02M_impro07_M002	 U.S.C..	Ses02M-impro07-07-01-M002.wav	07

Ses02M_impro07_M018	 What?	Ses02M-impro07-07-01-M018.wav	07
Ses04M_script01_1_M022	 Sometimes you infuriate me, you know that?  Isn't it your business, too, if I tell this to father and he throws a fit about it?  You have such a talent for ignoring things.	Ses04M-script01-05-01-1_M022.wav	05
Ses04M_script01_2_F003	 Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.	Ses04M-script01-05-01-2_F003.wav	05
Ses02M_impro07_M032	 [LAUGHTER] Thanks, yes, thanks, yes That'll be cool.	Ses02M-impro07-07-01-M032.wav	07

Ses04M_script01_2_F011	 Nobody in this house dares take her faith away, Joe.  Strangers might, but not his father, not his brother.	Ses04M-script01-05-01-2_F011.wav	05
Ses04M_script01_2_F012	 I want you to act like he's coming back, both of you.  Don't think I haven't noticed you since he invited her here.  I won't stand for any nonsense.	Ses04M-script01-05-01-2_F012.wav	05
Ses02M_impro08_M000	 All right. Customer service this is Steve.	Ses02M-impro08-01-01-M000.wav	01
Ses02M_impro08_M002	 Right. No, yes I know. It is-It is a little frustrating.	Ses02M-impro08-01-01-M002.wav	01
Ses04M_script02_1_F014	 What are you so excited about?	Ses04M-script02-01-01-1_F014.wav	01
Ses04M_script02_1_M009	 Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  We should have brought the blanket, our blanket.	Ses04M-script02-01-01-1_M009.wav	01
Ses02M_impro08_M011	 Yes, we'll get- we'll get rid of it right now. I mean just we're going to have to have you, um, submit something you know, we're going to have to have you mail something in for us, okay.	Ses02M-impro08-01-01-M011.wav	01
Ses04M_script02_1_M012	 You want my jacket?	Ses04M-script02-01-01-1_M012.wav	01
Ses04M_script02_1_M014	 Right.	Ses04M-script02-01-01-1_M014.wav	01
Ses04M_script02_2_M001	 What I said.	Ses04M-script02-01-01-2_M001.wav	01
Ses02M_impro08_M017	 Right. I mean we might	Ses02M-impro08-01-01-M017.wav	01
Ses04M_script02_2_M021	 It was in the car, right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker?  You said let's get some champagne and I said times a wasting or something like that.  Right?  That's it, right?  You want this to be like the other time.  That's it.  Of course.	Ses04M-script02-01-01-2_M021.wav	01
Ses02M_impro08_M021	 so it is a little a little hard in that situation if you want -- you know you can -um- we can- we can issue another credit card.	Ses02M-impro08-01-01-M021.wav	01
Ses02M_impro08_M024	 Yeah. yeah.	Ses02M-impro08-01-01-M024.wav	01
Ses02M_impro08_M026	 Okay. All right. Then we'll get it sent out there. And	Ses02M-impro08-01-01-M026.wav	01
Ses04M_script02_1_F005	 Yes.	Ses04M-script02-05-01-1_F005.wav	05
Ses04M_script02_1_F013	 Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach, flop around and then they swim away.  And then they die.	Ses04M-script02-05-01-1_F013.wav	05
Ses04M_script02_1_F017	 Yes.	Ses04M-script02-05-01-1_F017.wav	05
Ses02M_script01_1_F025	 How do you know she'll marry you? Maybe she feels the same way your father does.	Ses02M-script01-01-01-1_F025.wav	01
Ses04M_script02_2_F013	 I did want to see it.  I always do.  I keep thinking this time will be the time, but it never is.	Ses04M-script02-05-01-2_F013.wav	05
Ses04M_script02_2_F025	 No.	Ses04M-script02-05-01-2_F025.wav	05
Ses04M_script02_2_F028	 Oh, right, sure.  This is standing on the beach.   This is waiting.  This is fighting.	Ses04M-script02-05-01-2_F028.wav	05
Ses02M_script01_1_M003	 I don't know. When it cracked he ran into the house and cried in the kitchen.	Ses02M-script01-04-01-1_M003.wav	04
Ses02M_script01_1_M028	 I don't know, I'll find out. Then we'll trash it out with dad, right? Mom, don't avoid me.	Ses02M-script01-04-01-1_M028.wav	04
Ses04M_script02_1_M021	 Oh, it's a big night for these guys.  Uh, life's last orgy.	Ses04M-script02-07-01-1_M021.wav	07
Ses04M_script02_1_M033	 Well so what did you think?	Ses04M-script02-07-01-1_M033.wav	07
Ses04M_script03_1_M003	 We'll be alright, darling.  Whatever happens, aren't we?	Ses04M-script03-01-01-1_M003.wav	01
Ses04M_script03_1_M010	 Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing, love?	Ses04M-script03-01-01-1_M010.wav	01
Ses02M_script01_3_M026	 Just about all.	Ses02M-script01-04-01-3_M026.wav	04
Ses04M_script03_1_M033	 As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.	Ses04M-script03-01-01-1_M033.wav	01
Ses04M_script03_2_F024	 It's a pity you didn't- It's a pity you didn't have more brandy.	Ses04M-script03-01-01-2_F024.wav	01
Ses02M_script01_3_M032	 Then I came back and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here. I mean, the whole thing to them seemed like it's sort of a bus accident.  I went to work with Dad and that rat race again.	Ses02M-script01-04-01-3_M032.wav	04
Ses02M_script01_1_F026	 Trouble is you don't see enough women, you never did.	Ses02M-script01-05-01-1_F026.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_1_M013	 All the futile moralists who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.  Laugh at everything.  All their sacred shibboleths.  Flippancy brings out the acid- acid in their damn sweetness and light.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-1_M013.wav	05
Ses02M_script01_1_F032	 What the hell is this?	Ses02M-script01-05-01-1_F032.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_1_M025	 Horrible thing.  I hated it.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-1_M025.wav	05
Ses02M_script01_1_F037	 Well, you don't want to think like that.	Ses02M-script01-05-01-1_F037.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_F022	 Oh, no, it isn't.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_F022.wav	05
Ses02M_script01_1_M025	 To hell with that.	Ses02M-script01-05-01-1_M025.wav	05
Ses02M_script01_1_M037	 I've been a good son too long a good sucker, I'm through with it.	Ses02M-script01-05-01-1_M037.wav	05
Ses02M_script01_2_F001	 She's been in New York three and half years why all of a sudden-	Ses02M-script01-05-01-2_F001.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_F035	 Not very funny, dear.  You'd better have some more brandy.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_F035.wav	05
Ses02M_script01_2_F005	 What's going on here Joe?	Ses02M-script01-05-01-2_F005.wav	05
Ses02M_script01_3_M014	 You felt something that far back?	Ses02M-script01-07-01-3_M014.wav	07
Ses04M_script03_2_F046	 Stop.  I hate you.  Do you hear me? You're conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_F046.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_F047	 This is the end.  Do you understand, the end?  Finally and forever.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_F047.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_F051	 Never, never, never.  I'd rather die in torment. Beast brute.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_F051.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_F052	 Swine.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_F052.wav	05
Ses02M_script02_1_F020	 That's the wind.	Ses02M-script02-01-01-1_F020.wav	01
Ses04M_script03_2_M008	 You must admit that he was in love with you, wasn't he?	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M008.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_M010	 You let him kiss you.  You said you did.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M010.wav	05
Ses02M_script02_2_M002	 Certainly it's not. Slightly exaggerated scientific fact.	Ses02M-script02-01-01-2_M002.wav	01
Ses04M_script03_2_M020	 Really, Amanda	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M020.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_M021	 Nothing.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M021.wav	05
Ses02M_script02_2_M021	 Yea. Okay, sure, no. I see. Listen, you want to dance?	Ses02M-script02-01-01-2_M021.wav	01
Ses02M_script02_2_M022	 You want to go get some champagne?	Ses02M-script02-01-01-2_M022.wav	01
Ses04M_script03_2_M027	 It's a pity you didn't have any more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M027.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_M029	 Snap.  Oh, snap, snap, snap, like a little adder.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M029.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_M033	 I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more then, hmm?	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M033.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_M035	 No restraint at all, very enjoyable.  You never had much anyhow.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M035.wav	05
Ses02M_script02_2_F019	 Just dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle.	Ses02M-script02-04-01-2_F019.wav	04
Ses02M_script02_2_F021	 No.	Ses02M-script02-04-01-2_F021.wav	04
Ses04M_script03_2_M041	 You better turn that off I think.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M041.wav	05
Ses02M_script02_2_F034	 I know that you meant this to be special and nice, and there's the sand and the moon and everything but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.	Ses02M-script02-04-01-2_F034.wav	04
Ses02M_script02_2_F044	 Augie, I'm sorry.	Ses02M-script02-04-01-2_F044.wav	04
Ses04M_script03_2_M049	 You're a vile tempered, loosed living	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M049.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_M056	 Whore.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M056.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_1_F006	 Behave exquisitely.	Ses04M-script03-07-01-1_F006.wav	07
Ses02M_script02_1_M004	 Is that -- is that, no? Was that just foam? I can't even tell.	Ses02M-script02-07-01-1_M004.wav	07
Ses02M_script02_1_M016	 You think they can hear us talk or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around?	Ses02M-script02-07-01-1_M016.wav	07
Ses02M_script02_1_M025	 Yea, but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives. I mean all that flopping is laying eggs or what do you, mating or spotting or something like that.	Ses02M-script02-07-01-1_M025.wav	07
Ses04M_script03_1_F027	 That was the first time you ever hit me.	Ses04M-script03-07-01-1_F027.wav	07
Ses04M_script03_1_M029	 How -- that was a rouser wasn't it?	Ses04M-script03-07-01-1_M029.wav	07

Ses05F_impro02_F012	 I think infantry.  I'm not sure.	Ses05F-impro02-04-01-F012.wav	04
Ses05F_impro02_F021	 I don't think there's anything we can do.	Ses05F-impro02-04-01-F021.wav	04
Ses02M_script03_2_M024	 Tell me, did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?	Ses02M-script03-01-01-2_M024.wav	01
Ses02M_script03_1_M009	 Oh darling don't say that.	Ses02M-script03-04-01-1_M009.wav	04
Ses05F_impro02_F031	 I'm going to miss their first words.	Ses05F-impro02-04-01-F031.wav	04
Ses02M_script03_2_F014	 What?	Ses02M-script03-05-01-2_F014.wav	05
Ses02M_script03_2_F036	 Stop it. Stop it. I hate you.	Ses02M-script03-05-01-2_F036.wav	05
Ses05F_impro02_F038	 I love you.  I'm going to miss you so much. "sigh"	Ses05F-impro02-04-01-F038.wav	04
Ses05F_impro02_M024	 I'll tell them I'm sick and that you can't leave something.	Ses05F-impro02-04-01-M024.wav	04
Ses05F_impro02_M025	 It's not fair.	Ses05F-impro02-04-01-M025.wav	04
Ses02M_script03_2_F040	 Oh yes I am.	Ses02M-script03-05-01-2_F040.wav	05

Ses05F_impro02_M010	 Where do you have to go?  Where are you going?	Ses05F-impro02-05-01-M010.wav	05
Ses05F_impro02_M014	 I don't understand why they would just do something like this?	Ses05F-impro02-05-01-M014.wav	05
Ses05F_impro02_M015	 It doesn't make any sense.  It's stupid.  I told you you shouldn't go in the Army.	Ses05F-impro02-05-01-M015.wav	05
Ses02M_script03_2_M042	 You're a vile tempered, loose living, wicked little beast and I hope I never see you again as long as I live.	Ses02M-script03-05-01-2_M042.wav	05
Ses05F_impro03_F000	 Okay, so big news.	Ses05F-impro03-07-01-F000.wav	07
