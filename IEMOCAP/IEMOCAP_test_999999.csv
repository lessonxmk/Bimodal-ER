Ses01F_impro02_F017	 We've got friends, that's why we moved here, huh?  Because there is a day care down the street.	Ses01F-impro02-04-01-F017.wav	04

Ses03F_impro08_F029	 Okay? Thank you for calling.  Goodbye.	Ses03F-impro08-01-01-F029.wav	01
Ses03F_impro08_M021	 About three million dollars.	Ses03F-impro08-01-01-M021.wav	01
Ses05F_impro07_M015	 You're going to have so much fun.  And there's lo- tons of people, you're going to meet so many people, I'm going to meet so many people too, because we're going to be there together.	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-M015.wav	07
Ses05F_impro07_M016	 Sure, why not.  I don't know why not, I'm not doing anything I have no plans, I could live anywhere I want.	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-M016.wav	07
Ses05F_impro07_M018	 We should try to find, like, a party spot though, like you know where there's going to be a lot of parties, where there are cool people, though.  Do you know any people that might be out there?	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-M018.wav	07
Ses03F_impro08_M008	 What?  It's my phone.  You can't even call me on it. I don't have another phone.	Ses03F-impro08-05-01-M008.wav	05

Ses03F_impro08_M012	 A free calling card?	Ses03F-impro08-05-01-M012.wav	05
Ses05F_impro07_M026	 You're a wild and crazy woman.	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-M026.wav	07
Ses05F_impro07_M029	 living near the U.S.C. campus by myself, not going to school there. just really pathetic and sad.	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-M029.wav	07
Ses03F_script01_1_F004	 Did you talk to him?	Ses03F-script01-01-01-1_F004.wav	01
Ses01F_impro03_F015	 Yeah, so [LAUGHTER] He's calling me now	Ses01F-impro03-07-01-F015.wav	07
Ses01F_impro03_M003	 Who did you marry?	Ses01F-impro03-07-01-M003.wav	07
Ses01F_impro03_M022	 Awesome.	Ses01F-impro03-07-01-M022.wav	07
Ses03F_script01_1_F019	 Why?	Ses03F-script01-01-01-1_F019.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_1_F030	 You're a considerate fella and there's nothing wrong in that.	Ses03F-script01-01-01-1_F030.wav	01
Ses05F_impro07_M033	 That's a good idea.	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-M033.wav	07
Ses05F_impro08_F002	 [LAUGHTER] All right.  I'm sorry, sir that you've been having a hard time.	Ses05F-impro08-01-01-F002.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_1_F050	 I'm going to.	Ses03F-script01-01-01-1_F050.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_1_M000	 He saw it.	Ses03F-script01-01-01-1_M000.wav	01
Ses01F_impro04_M006	 He's like a house manager. Yeah.  It's a good job.	Ses01F-impro04-01-01-M006.wav	01
Ses05F_impro08_F017	 Okay, I do see that on here, and it says that um, it had some trouble clearing for some reason.  And I think that was the problem on our end.  So um-	Ses05F-impro08-01-01-F017.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_1_M016	 You know-you know why I asked Annie here, right?	Ses03F-script01-01-01-1_M016.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_1_M017	 You know.	Ses03F-script01-01-01-1_M017.wav	01
Ses05F_impro08_F019	 Yeah, we- Somebody went in and- and cleared the problem and it looks like you're all paid.	Ses05F-impro08-01-01-F019.wav	01
Ses01F_impro04_M016	 Yeah.  But the piece of paper helps, too.	Ses01F-impro04-01-01-M016.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_1_M029	 I wanted to get this settled first.	Ses03F-script01-01-01-1_M029.wav	01
Ses01F_impro04_M018	 I know.  Okay.  Well, um. Maybe--	Ses01F-impro04-01-01-M018.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_1_M030	 Well then I guess it's over then. But from her letters I think she's forgotten him.	Ses03F-script01-01-01-1_M030.wav	01
Ses01F_impro04_M020	 Okay, yeah.  I would imagine.	Ses01F-impro04-01-01-M020.wav	01
Ses01F_impro04_M021	 Well, sometimes you have to do things that you don't necessarily like to do to have a job. But the job affords you money, you won't have to be taking the bus right now.	Ses01F-impro04-01-01-M021.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_1_M048	 Yes. On this I would.	Ses03F-script01-01-01-1_M048.wav	01
Ses01F_impro04_M032	 I- I-I didn't-- okay.	Ses01F-impro04-01-01-M032.wav	01
Ses01F_impro04_F029	 Who do you think you are?	Ses01F-impro04-05-01-F029.wav	05
Ses03F_script01_2_M006	 You can't read her mind.	Ses03F-script01-01-01-2_M006.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_2_M007	 How do you know why she's waited?	Ses03F-script01-01-01-2_M007.wav	01
Ses05F_script01_1_F017	 Well I got an idea.  But what's the story?	Ses05F-script01-01-01-1_F017.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_3_M001	 You're not sorry you came?	Ses03F-script01-01-01-3_M001.wav	01
Ses01F_impro05_M004	 Okay.	Ses01F-impro05-01-01-M004.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_1_M026	 Every time I reach out for something I have to pull back because other people will suffer. My whole entire life, time and time after time.	Ses03F-script01-04-01-1_M026.wav	04
Ses01F_impro05_M006	 Okay.	Ses01F-impro05-01-01-M006.wav	01
Ses05F_script01_1_F027	 The trouble is you don't see enough women, you never have	Ses05F-script01-01-01-1_F027.wav	01
Ses05F_script01_2_M002	 What did you mean? He lived next door to the girl all of his life, why wouldn't he want to see her again? Don't look at me like that, he didn't tell me any more than he told you.	Ses05F-script01-01-01-2_M002.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_3_F008	 Well, you've been embarrassed ever since I came.	Ses03F-script01-04-01-3_F008.wav	04
Ses03F_script01_3_F025	 No. What is it? Is it your mother?	Ses03F-script01-04-01-3_F025.wav	04
Ses01F_impro05_M016	 No.  I'm just giving you money, the bag is gone.  If it's not here, I'm really sorry there is nothing I can do because...	Ses01F-impro05-01-01-M016.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_3_F032	 And you still feel that way?	Ses03F-script01-04-01-3_F032.wav	04
Ses05F_script01_1_F031	 You marry his girl, and you're pronouncing him dead.  Now what's going to happen to your father, do you know?  I don't.	Ses05F-script01-04-01-1_F031.wav	04
Ses01F_impro05_M026	 You know, the airlines can not be held responsible for every bag of luggage that comes through here.	Ses01F-impro05-01-01-M026.wav	01
Ses05F_script01_1_M004	 No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone.	Ses05F-script01-04-01-1_M004.wav	04
Ses03F_script01_3_M034	 I mean, that's-that's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had. They didn't just die. They killed themselves for each other. And I mean that exactly. A little more selfish and they'd still be here today.	Ses03F-script01-04-01-3_M034.wav	04
Ses01F_impro05_F009	 Am I going to be getting, like, free tickets, free mileage. When can I expect my bag here?	Ses01F-impro05-05-01-F009.wav	05
Ses01F_impro05_F011	 Is this a joke?	Ses01F-impro05-05-01-F011.wav	05
Ses05F_script01_1_M016	 You know why I asked Annie here, don't you?	Ses05F-script01-04-01-1_M016.wav	04
Ses03F_script01_1_M021	 See, then it's not just my business. God, you have	Ses03F-script01-05-01-1_M021.wav	05
Ses01F_impro05_F019	 If you're- if you're- if you're looking for a lawsuit, baby, you've found it.	Ses01F-impro05-05-01-F019.wav	05
Ses03F_script01_1_M027	 To hell with that.	Ses03F-script01-05-01-1_M027.wav	05
Ses03F_script01_1_M046	 Now, Annie's in the middle of all that.	Ses03F-script01-05-01-1_M046.wav	05
Ses05F_script01_3_M028	 for instance, there's this one time.  It had been raining for several days.  And this kid came up to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks. you know, He just put them in my pocket.	Ses05F-script01-04-01-3_M028.wav	04
Ses01F_impro05_F026	 What's your name?	Ses01F-impro05-05-01-F026.wav	05
Ses01F_impro05_F030	 A letter? I'll make a personal phone call.	Ses01F-impro05-05-01-F030.wav	05
Ses01F_impro06_F016	 I brought- I brought Chuck with me. He went to Redlands, yeah, for the day.  We ran through the sprinklers.	Ses01F-impro06-01-01-F016.wav	01
Ses03F_script02_1_M017	 Do you want my jacket?	Ses03F-script02-01-01-1_M017.wav	01
Ses01F_impro06_M006	 Mmhmm.	Ses01F-impro06-01-01-M006.wav	01
Ses01F_impro06_M009	 Mmhmm.	Ses01F-impro06-01-01-M009.wav	01
Ses01F_impro06_M011	 You ran through the sprinklers in the cemetery?	Ses01F-impro06-01-01-M011.wav	01
Ses05F_script01_2_F017	 I can't help it!	Ses05F-script01-05-01-2_F017.wav	05
Ses05F_script01_2_M016	 What do you mean me above all?  Look at you.  You're shaking!	Ses05F-script01-05-01-2_M016.wav	05
Ses01F_impro06_M014	 Mmhmm.	Ses01F-impro06-01-01-M014.wav	01
Ses01F_impro06_M015	 Mmhmm.	Ses01F-impro06-01-01-M015.wav	01
Ses01F_impro06_F002	 No.	Ses01F-impro06-04-01-F002.wav	04
Ses05F_script01_3_M017	 Oh Annie, we're going to live now.  I'm going to make you so happy.	Ses05F-script01-07-01-3_M017.wav	07
Ses05F_script02_1_F000	 Fine.	Ses05F-script02-01-01-1_F000.wav	01
Ses01F_impro06_F007	 So I was like wandering around before.  It takes forever to find her headstone; I always lose it. You know.	Ses01F-impro06-04-01-F007.wav	04
Ses01F_impro06_F010	 Yeah.  And she was like, that's pathetic, I hope you enjoy it.	Ses01F-impro06-04-01-F010.wav	04
Ses03F_script02_2_F022	 I told myself finally, this is how happy I'm supposed to be.	Ses03F-script02-04-01-2_F022.wav	04
Ses05F_script02_1_F015	 I am just not.	Ses05F-script02-01-01-1_F015.wav	01
Ses05F_script02_1_F016	 Yes.	Ses05F-script02-01-01-1_F016.wav	01
Ses01F_impro06_F021	 My best friend Heather.  She's got a- we have a- we built this like little--  There's a park, Prospect Park.  And there is like a garden section of it that we set up for her.	Ses01F-impro06-04-01-F021.wav	04
Ses05F_script02_2_M005	 Carla, can I ask you a question?  Now don't be upset, are you having a period?	Ses05F-script02-01-01-2_M005.wav	01
Ses03F_script02_2_F051	 I'm sorry, Augie.	Ses03F-script02-04-01-2_F051.wav	04
Ses03F_script02_2_F012	 Like I feel like my whole life I've been just standing on this beach with my hands clasped waiting for these fish to show up and these fish never show up.	Ses03F-script02-05-01-2_F012.wav	05
Ses05F_script02_2_F025	 This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.	Ses05F-script02-04-01-2_F025.wav	04
Ses01F_impro07_M012	 Is this a Masters or a P.h.D.?  Or can you...? Nice	Ses01F-impro07-01-01-M012.wav	01
Ses05F_script02_2_F028	 I mean it is just this , I mean it includes a lot and everything and you know it's the sand and it's the full moon and I just-I am sorry but I couldn't help wishing I was somewhere else.	Ses05F-script02-04-01-2_F028.wav	04
Ses03F_script02_1_M001	 Look at the night we got; couldn't be better.	Ses03F-script02-07-01-1_M001.wav	07
Ses01F_impro07_F004	 I don't know.  I spend so much time commuting as it is, I'd rather.	Ses01F-impro07-07-01-F004.wav	07
Ses01F_impro07_F013	 I would be like- Oh. Right, right, right.	Ses01F-impro07-07-01-F013.wav	07
Ses05F_script02_1_M003	 Oh no, you know what I did.  I forgot my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I can't believe I forgot my flashlight.	Ses05F-script02-07-01-1_M003.wav	07
Ses01F_impro07_M004	 Oh.  Good, good.  That's awesome. Are you going to stay around here?  Or are you going to like get a different neighborhood- you going to move to a different neighborhood?	Ses01F-impro07-07-01-M004.wav	07
Ses01F_impro07_M005	 This is so- I am so happy that you're going to stay.  You're not going to...We should totally throw a party.	Ses01F-impro07-07-01-M005.wav	07
Ses03F_script02_1_M040	 its single-mindedness with one mind. Urgency that's pure urge. You know, they don't give it a name.	Ses03F-script02-07-01-1_M040.wav	07
Ses05F_script02_1_M020	 Yeah but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives, all that flopping around is laying eggs or what you- mating or spawning or something like that.	Ses05F-script02-07-01-1_M020.wav	07
Ses01F_impro07_M014	 Teacher. Mrs. Nash, I have a question.	Ses01F-impro07-07-01-M014.wav	07
Ses05F_script02_1_M029	 Look there, what's that?  Is it?  Is that a--Ah, it's a seaweed isn't it?	Ses05F-script02-07-01-1_M029.wav	07
Ses03F_script03_2_F004	 Just a little perhaps, but it was nothing serious.	Ses03F-script03-01-01-2_F004.wav	01
Ses05F_script02_1_M032	 It's just some little instinctual time-release firecracker that went off inside them and all this one they turn around and form a line as long as the California coast and just started swimming.	Ses05F-script02-07-01-1_M032.wav	07
Ses05F_script02_1_M034	 Well, So what do you think?	Ses05F-script02-07-01-1_M034.wav	07
Ses05F_script02_2_M019	 You want me to go get some champagne?	Ses05F-script02-07-01-2_M019.wav	07
Ses01F_script01_1_M012	 Sit down, Mom.  I want to talk to you.	Ses01F-script01-01-01-1_M012.wav	01
Ses05F_script03_1_F010	 The whole business is really rather ridiculous.	Ses05F-script03-01-01-1_F010.wav	01
Ses01F_script01_1_M017	 So all right then, I'll just go ahead with it?	Ses01F-script01-01-01-1_M017.wav	01
Ses05F_script03_1_F019	 Well, what if one of us dies, does the other laugh then?	Ses05F-script03-01-01-1_F019.wav	01
Ses01F_script01_1_M025	 And then we'll thrash it out with father.  Okay Mom?  Don't avoid me.	Ses01F-script01-01-01-1_M025.wav	01
Ses01F_script01_1_M034	 I'll get out.  I'll get married and I'll move somewhere else, maybe New York.	Ses01F-script01-01-01-1_M034.wav	01
Ses01F_script01_1_M039	 On this, I would.	Ses01F-script01-01-01-1_M039.wav	01
Ses03F_script03_2_F037	 I will not. Go away. Go away. I hate you.	Ses03F-script03-05-01-2_F037.wav	05
Ses05F_script03_2_F000	 You knew there was nothing in that.	Ses05F-script03-01-01-2_F000.wav	01
Ses03F_script03_2_F041	 Oh, yes I am.	Ses03F-script03-05-01-2_F041.wav	05
Ses05F_script03_2_F004	 maybe just a little, but--	Ses05F-script03-01-01-2_F004.wav	01
Ses01F_script01_3_F000	 You're the only one who still loves his parents.	Ses01F-script01-01-01-3_F000.wav	01
Ses03F_script03_2_M000	 As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.	Ses03F-script03-05-01-2_M000.wav	05

Ses03F_script03_2_M030	 Okay. As I mentioned before, I said I had three very minute liquor glasses. That's hardly enough to get a child of two drunk.	Ses03F-script03-05-01-2_M030.wav	05
Ses01F_script01_3_M003	 Well.	Ses01F-script01-01-01-3_M003.wav	01

Ses01F_script01_2_F010	 I want you to-- I want you to act like he is coming back, both of you.  Don't think I haven't noticed you since Chris invited her here.	Ses01F-script01-05-01-2_F010.wav	05
Ses01F_script01_2_F011	 I won't stand for any nonsense.	Ses01F-script01-05-01-2_F011.wav	05
Ses05F_script03_1_M001	 I wonder.	Ses05F-script03-07-01-1_M001.wav	07
Ses05F_script03_1_M011	 What does it all mean?  That's what I asked myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean?	Ses05F-script03-07-01-1_M011.wav	07
Ses05F_script03_1_M014	 Certainly you must.  We're figures of fun alright [LAUGHTER].	Ses05F-script03-07-01-1_M014.wav	07

Ses01F_script02_1_M023	 Why not?	Ses01F-script02-01-01-1_M023.wav	01
Ses05M_impro01_F001	 Oh, this- this form that you have is the wrong form.  You need to go over to the other line on the other side of the D.M.V..	Ses05M-impro01-01-01-F001.wav	01
Ses01F_script02_1_M029	 There's like mystery here, there's magic.  It's like a little bit of the unexplainable.  I just can't see how you're not interested.	Ses01F-script02-01-01-1_M029.wav	01

Ses03M_script01_3_M040	 cause you can take those things out of the war.  But you got to know, when you drive that car that it came out of the love that a man can have for a man and you got to be a little bit better because of that.	Ses03M-script01-04-01-3_M040.wav	04
Ses01M_impro07_F003	 Pinch hitting softball.	Ses01M-impro07-07-01-F003.wav	07
Ses03M_script01_3_M041	 Otherwise what you have is loot and there's blood on it.	Ses03M-script01-04-01-3_M041.wav	04
Ses03M_script01_3_M042	 And I didn't want to take any of it and I guess that included you.	Ses03M-script01-04-01-3_M042.wav	04
Ses03M_script01_1_F016	 No.  It's his god damned newspapers is what it is.  Now every month there's a new boy comes home and Larry's going to be the next one.	Ses03M-script01-05-01-1_F016.wav	05
Ses03M_script01_1_F020	 Well what do you want me to do?  I mean, you're old enough to know your own mind.	Ses03M-script01-05-01-1_F020.wav	05
Ses03M_script01_1_F043	 I mean what the hell have we worked for then?  I mean, it's all for you Chris.  The whole shooting match is for you.	Ses03M-script01-05-01-1_F043.wav	05
Ses01M_impro07_F009	 That is amazing, congratulations. Good for you.	Ses01M-impro07-07-01-F009.wav	07
Ses05M_script01_1_M028	 So what?  I'm not fast with women.	Ses05M-script01-05-01-1_M028.wav	05
Ses05M_script01_1_M033	 But if that can't happen, I'll just have to get out.	Ses05M-script01-05-01-1_M033.wav	05
Ses05M_script01_1_M035	 I have been a good son for too long.  A good sucker.  I'm through with it.	Ses05M-script01-05-01-1_M035.wav	05
Ses01M_impro07_F015	 I don't know. Commuting from what Malibu that would be ridiculous.	Ses01M-impro07-07-01-F015.wav	07
Ses05M_script01_1_M036	 Yes.  On this, I would.	Ses05M-script01-05-01-1_M036.wav	05
Ses05M_script01_1_M037	 Well, you help me stay here.	Ses05M-script01-05-01-1_M037.wav	05
Ses05M_script01_3_F015	 Not like that you're not.	Ses05M-script01-07-01-3_F015.wav	07
Ses05M_script01_3_M016	 oh, God I kissed Annie.  I kissed Annie. I can't How long have I waited to do that?	Ses05M-script01-07-01-3_M016.wav	07
Ses05M_script01_3_M041	 Oh, Annie,	Ses05M-script01-07-01-3_M041.wav	07
Ses01M_impro07_F026	 No, no.  I love softball. I played softball all the time.	Ses01M-impro07-07-01-F026.wav	07
Ses03M_script01_2_F012	 No.  Nobody in my house better dare and challenge her faith.  You know and maybe strangers but not his father, not his brother.	Ses03M-script01-05-01-2_F012.wav	05
Ses01M_impro07_M003	 Yeah.  Well, I don't--well yeah I can pitch, I'm not like the pitcher though. I'm like the pinch hitter guy I mostly just hit.  But I guess I'm going to have to... Yeah, and then I play shortstop too but... It's so ex- The good news is I get to stay here.	Ses01M-impro07-07-01-M003.wav	07
Ses05M_script02_2_F012	 I did want to see it.  I always want to see it.  I just- I keep thinking this will be the time and it never is.	Ses05M-script02-04-01-2_F012.wav	04
Ses01M_impro07_M007	 Thank you.	Ses01M-impro07-07-01-M007.wav	07
Ses01M_impro07_M008	 But I don't know I want to live in the housing that they give me though 'cause I think I want to you know like get like a nicer place.	Ses01M-impro07-07-01-M008.wav	07
Ses03M_script02_1_M017	 Do you want my jacket?	Ses03M-script02-01-01-1_M017.wav	01
Ses03M_script02_2_M017	 Let's see I took a shower, you were watching the news, you said hey, hey the Grunions are running tonight and I said great let's go, I feel lucky tonight.	Ses03M-script02-01-01-2_M017.wav	01
Ses03M_script02_2_M019	 Wait a minute.  I've got it.	Ses03M-script02-01-01-2_M019.wav	01
Ses03M_script02_2_M020	 It was in the car right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker...	Ses03M-script02-01-01-2_M020.wav	01
Ses05M_script02_2_F015	 Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle.	Ses05M-script02-04-01-2_F015.wav	04
Ses05M_script02_2_F016	 I would rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for something.	Ses05M-script02-04-01-2_F016.wav	04
Ses05M_script02_2_F018	 No.	Ses05M-script02-04-01-2_F018.wav	04
Ses03M_script02_2_F023	 I'd rather not remember something...	Ses03M-script02-04-01-2_F023.wav	04
Ses03M_script02_2_F024	 Rather not hope for something.	Ses03M-script02-04-01-2_F024.wav	04
Ses05M_script02_2_F026	 But this isn't at all what I wanted it to be.	Ses05M-script02-04-01-2_F026.wav	04
Ses05M_script02_2_F028	 I know that, Augie.  I do.  I know that. And and I know that this meant a lot to you and and it's special, you know, with the sand and the moon but.	Ses05M-script02-04-01-2_F028.wav	04
Ses05M_script02_2_F030	 I didn't say that.	Ses05M-script02-04-01-2_F030.wav	04
Ses01M_script01_3_F004	 For one thing your mother as much as told me to go.	Ses01M-script01-01-01-3_F004.wav	01
Ses03M_script02_2_F041	 Well, I guess this is the wrong spot for the right people.	Ses03M-script02-04-01-2_F041.wav	04
Ses03M_script02_2_M036	 Maybe if you were with someone else too.	Ses03M-script02-04-01-2_M036.wav	04
Ses01M_script01_3_M004	 What?	Ses01M-script01-01-01-3_M004.wav	01
Ses03M_script02_2_F001	 It's ridiculous.	Ses03M-script02-05-01-2_F001.wav	05
Ses01M_script01_3_M014	 Why didn't you?	Ses01M-script01-01-01-3_M014.wav	01
Ses03M_script02_2_F003	 Yeah.  Everyone else was sold the same thing.  I mean, look, it keeps us excited, it keeps us coming back for more and you know, keeps us thinking life's going to start any minute now.	Ses03M-script02-05-01-2_F003.wav	05
Ses05M_script02_2_M025	 Do you think that I thought there would be times when you would look at me like I was used Kleenex or I would look at you and think, good God, when's the next flight to Alaska?  No.  No, I'm just like you. I thought it would all be like peaches and roses, and sand in our toes, and wind in our hair, and the fish would always come.  And the bills would magically pay themselves.  And we'd have three fat rosy kids.  But, ha ha, baby, the jokes on us!	Ses05M-script02-05-01-2_M025.wav	05
Ses01M_script01_1_F031	 He thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl you're pronouncing him dead.	Ses01M-script01-04-01-1_F031.wav	04
Ses05M_script02_1_M002	 This is great.  How are you doing?  Oh, no.  Oh, do you know what I did?  I forgot the flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I forgot the flashlight.	Ses05M-script02-07-01-1_M002.wav	07
Ses01M_script01_1_M004	 No.  I figured I'd just let it wait.	Ses01M-script01-04-01-1_M004.wav	04
Ses05M_script02_1_M006	 How could we have forgotten it? Well, I hope the moon stays out.  I wonder, do they always run during a full moon?  I can't remember, was the moon full last year, do you remember?	Ses05M-script02-07-01-1_M006.wav	07
Ses03M_script02_2_M028	 Welcome to the human race.	Ses03M-script02-05-01-2_M028.wav	05
Ses03M_script02_2_M031	 ...and you know?  Baby the jokes on us.  Because you know what you get?  Do you know what you get Carla?  You get this.	Ses03M-script02-05-01-2_M031.wav	05
Ses03M_script02_1_M000	 Hey, what time is it?  This pokes around midnight right?  God this is great isn't it?	Ses03M-script02-07-01-1_M000.wav	07
Ses03M_script02_1_M002	 You know actually I wanted to go a little further up the coast and get away from all the lights and people but I was afraid you'd miss it.  How are you doing?	Ses03M-script02-07-01-1_M002.wav	07
Ses01M_script01_3_F022	 Wouldn't work like this.	Ses01M-script01-04-01-3_F022.wav	04
Ses05M_script02_1_M033	 Well, so what do you think?	Ses05M-script02-07-01-1_M033.wav	07
Ses01M_script01_3_M023	 I don't know.	Ses01M-script01-04-01-3_M023.wav	04
Ses01M_script01_3_M024	 It's kind of all mixed up with all these other things.	Ses01M-script01-04-01-3_M024.wav	04
Ses03M_script02_1_M039	 It's single mindedness with no mind.  It's urgency that's pure urge and they don't, they don't ask it a question, they don't give it a name, they just swim.	Ses03M-script02-07-01-1_M039.wav	07
Ses03M_script02_1_M041	 Oh, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  Look, all my hairs are standing up.	Ses03M-script02-07-01-1_M041.wav	07
Ses03M_script02_1_M043	 About what I just said?	Ses03M-script02-07-01-1_M043.wav	07
Ses05M_script03_2_F012	 It's becoming a habit with you.	Ses05M-script03-01-01-2_F012.wav	01
Ses03M_script03_2_F000	 Oh, come on, you knew there was nothing in that.	Ses03M-script03-01-01-2_F000.wav	01
Ses03M_script03_2_F004	 Just a little perhaps but nothing serious.	Ses03M-script03-01-01-2_F004.wav	01
Ses05M_script03_2_M024	 So, did you see much of Peter Burden after the divorce?	Ses05M-script03-01-01-2_M024.wav	01
Ses01M_script01_3_M041	 I want you to know Annie.	Ses01M-script01-04-01-3_M041.wav	04
Ses03M_script03_2_F036	 They are away in Tunis.	Ses03M-script03-01-01-2_F036.wav	01
Ses05M_script03_2_F017	 No, it isn't.	Ses05M-script03-05-01-2_F017.wav	05
Ses05M_script03_2_F028	 Not- Would you shut up.	Ses05M-script03-05-01-2_F028.wav	05
Ses01M_script01_1_F016	 The trouble is those god damn news papers.  Every month some boy comes back missing longer then Larry so--	Ses01M-script01-05-01-1_F016.wav	05
Ses03M_script03_1_F018	 That's serious enough.	Ses03M-script03-04-01-1_F018.wav	04
Ses03M_script03_2_F001	 Presents?  A trivial little broach.	Ses03M-script03-05-01-2_F001.wav	05
Ses01M_script01_1_F030	 That's a good answer but it doesn't answer anything.  You haven't seen her since you went away to war, it's been five years.	Ses01M-script01-05-01-1_F030.wav	05
Ses01M_script01_1_F039	 Well, you don't want to think like that.	Ses01M-script01-05-01-1_F039.wav	05
Ses05M_script03_2_M015	 Amanda, really.	Ses05M-script03-05-01-2_M015.wav	05
Ses05M_script03_2_M025	 You must have let him kiss you quite a good deal more then, huh?	Ses05M-script03-05-01-2_M025.wav	05
Ses03M_script03_2_F038	 Very well.  If you insist on being a boorish and idiotic.	Ses03M-script03-05-01-2_F038.wav	05
Ses01M_script01_1_M041	 I am thinking like that.	Ses01M-script01-05-01-1_M041.wav	05
Ses03M_script03_2_F043	 Oh, yes I am. Yes I am and you can't stop me.	Ses03M-script03-05-01-2_F043.wav	05
Ses01M_script01_2_F001	 It's been three and a half years.  Why all of a sudden?	Ses01M-script01-05-01-2_F001.wav	05
Ses01M_script01_2_F004	 What is going on here, Joe?	Ses01M-script01-05-01-2_F004.wav	05
Ses03M_script03_2_M003	 You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.	Ses03M-script03-05-01-2_M003.wav	05
Ses03M_script03_2_M005	 You let him kiss you. You said so.  What of it?	Ses03M-script03-05-01-2_M005.wav	05
Ses01M_script01_2_F011	 Oh, laugh at me, laugh all you like but why does this happen to very night she comes back?  She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look at it, Joe look.	Ses01M-script01-05-01-2_F011.wav	05
Ses03M_script03_2_M007	 Oh, that's a nice point of view I must say.	Ses03M-script03-05-01-2_M007.wav	05
Ses05M_script03_2_M032	 You better turn that off, I think.	Ses05M-script03-05-01-2_M032.wav	05
Ses05M_script03_2_M033	 Because it's very late and you'll disturb the people upstairs.	Ses05M-script03-05-01-2_M033.wav	05
Ses03M_script03_2_M012	 Oh my...just because I just...okay...	Ses03M-script03-05-01-2_M012.wav	05
Ses05M_script03_2_M036	 I do I shall do no such thing.	Ses05M-script03-05-01-2_M036.wav	05
Ses05M_script03_2_M043	 [GARBAGE] No, you're not.	Ses05M-script03-05-01-2_M043.wav	05
Ses01M_script02_1_F007	 No.	Ses01M-script02-01-01-1_F007.wav	01
Ses03M_script03_2_M034	 You better turn that off.	Ses03M-script03-05-01-2_M034.wav	05
Ses01M_script02_1_M011	 Gosh, I should have brought it. I can't believe I forgot that.	Ses01M-script02-01-01-1_M011.wav	01
Ses03M_script03_2_M041	 Very amusing indeed.	Ses03M-script03-05-01-2_M041.wav	05
Ses05M_script03_1_M004	 I don't care then.	Ses05M-script03-07-01-1_M004.wav	07
Ses03M_script03_2_M045	 shut up. shut up.  I would-I would never marry you again if you came crawling back to me on your hands and knees because you're an evil-minded little vampire and I hope to God I never see you again.	Ses03M-script03-05-01-2_M045.wav	05
Ses01M_script02_1_M039	 Come on, trust me I got instincts for these things, okay?  So just--just think about it all right?  Okay, I know you're not interested, think about it...	Ses01M-script02-01-01-1_M039.wav	01
Ses01M_script02_2_F000	 That's the wind.	Ses01M-script02-01-01-2_F000.wav	01
Ses03M_script03_2_M046	 Oh.	Ses03M-script03-05-01-2_M046.wav	05
Ses01M_script02_2_M008	 Can I ask you a question?  Are you on your period?	Ses01M-script02-01-01-2_M008.wav	01
Ses01M_script02_2_M013	 We missed them twice.	Ses01M-script02-01-01-2_M013.wav	01
Ses01M_script02_2_M019	 you were fine during the phone call from Marge, dinner was okay, doing the dishes was fine.	Ses01M-script02-01-01-2_M019.wav	01
Ses03M_script03_1_M004	 I don't care then.	Ses03M-script03-07-01-1_M004.wav	07
Ses01M_script02_2_M021	 So I'm putting the animals out we're getting the car to the garage and--	Ses01M-script02-01-01-2_M021.wav	01
Ses03M_script03_1_M006	 No, wrong number.	Ses03M-script03-07-01-1_M006.wav	07
Ses04F_impro01_F008	 I've been to the back of the line five times.	Ses04F-impro01-05-01-F008.wav	05
Ses05M_script03_1_M015	 uh- the- Being flippant brings out the acid in their damned beauty and light.	Ses05M-script03-07-01-1_M015.wav	07
Ses04F_impro01_F014	 I mean look she's -she's perfectly nice.  She doesn't mind waiting for a couple of minutes because I've been here all day. I have a job to get back to.  I have kids to pick up from school.  I can't just stay here.	Ses04F-impro01-05-01-F014.wav	05
Ses05M_script03_1_M016	 Certainly you must.  We are figures of fun all right.	Ses05M-script03-07-01-1_M016.wav	07
Ses01M_script02_2_M029	 What? Huh?	Ses01M-script02-01-01-2_M029.wav	01
Ses04F_impro01_F019	 I'm testing your patience?	Ses04F-impro01-05-01-F019.wav	05
Ses05M_script03_1_M021	 No, no that is quit laughable.  The cutting little mystery all done with mirrors.	Ses05M-script03-07-01-1_M021.wav	07
Ses05M_script03_1_M025	 Do you remember that awful scene we had in Venice?	Ses05M-script03-07-01-1_M025.wav	07
Ses05M_script03_1_M026	 The one where you bought that little painted wooden stake and you put it on my bed.	Ses05M-script03-07-01-1_M026.wav	07
Ses04F_impro01_M011	 You're going to have to go back again.	Ses04F-impro01-05-01-M011.wav	05
Ses01M_script02_2_M054	 Or not.	Ses01M-script02-01-01-2_M054.wav	01
Ses04F_impro01_M021	 like I said before right now.	Ses04F-impro01-05-01-M021.wav	05
Ses04F_impro01_M024	 I work in this fucking building all day. And I'm sick of it, okay?	Ses04F-impro01-05-01-M024.wav	05
Ses04F_impro02_F002	 I don't know what to say.  I don't want to go but I don't have a lot of choice.	Ses04F-impro02-04-01-F002.wav	04
Ses04F_impro02_F005	 Well you have to have faith because I don't have a choice and I have to go.	Ses04F-impro02-04-01-F005.wav	04
Ses01M_script02_2_M037	 No, no I'm just like you, I thought it was going to be all rosy cheeks and the bills would pay themselves and fish will always come and--	Ses01M-script02-04-01-2_M037.wav	04
Ses01M_script02_2_M038	 No.  You know what you get?  You know what you get?  You get this.	Ses01M-script02-04-01-2_M038.wav	04
Ses04F_impro02_M000	 So you're leaving tomorrow.	Ses04F-impro02-04-01-M000.wav	04
Ses04F_impro02_M001	 This is really-this is unfair.	Ses04F-impro02-04-01-M001.wav	04
Ses04F_impro02_M004	 And, uh, I'm afraid that if you, you know, when you leave, you won't come back.	Ses04F-impro02-04-01-M004.wav	04
Ses01M_script02_2_M045	 Yeah?	Ses01M-script02-04-01-2_M045.wav	04
Ses01M_script02_1_F014	 Then let's go.	Ses01M-script02-05-01-1_F014.wav	05
Ses01M_script02_1_F021	 Yes.	Ses01M-script02-05-01-1_F021.wav	05
Ses04F_impro02_F017	 Thanks that helps.	Ses04F-impro02-05-01-F017.wav	05
Ses01M_script02_2_F011	 I just, we just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like.	Ses01M-script02-05-01-2_F011.wav	05
Ses04F_impro03_M001	 Uh, you got a new car, a new house. Uh, a dog.	Ses04F-impro03-01-01-M001.wav	01
Ses04F_impro03_M020	 I just think browns are really what you want to go with.  I mean I think there's more contrast between brown and green than there is-	Ses04F-impro03-01-01-M020.wav	01
Ses04F_impro03_M027	 Okay.  Fine.  So green and what?	Ses04F-impro03-01-01-M027.wav	01
Ses01M_script02_1_M002	 Look, there what's that, what's that?  Is it--	Ses01M-script02-07-01-1_M002.wav	07
Ses01M_script02_1_M005	 Gosh, this is great, isn't it?  This is awesome.  Oh, no you know what I forgot?	Ses01M-script02-07-01-1_M005.wav	07
Ses01M_script02_1_M031	 Well, okay whatever, okay but it's a fish who do something that like no other fish do, you know, it's like those swallows that return to Capistrano or those like those lemmings that jumped off the cliffs, you know.	Ses01M-script02-07-01-1_M031.wav	07
Ses01M_script02_1_M032	 It's like a little bit of the unexplainable, a little magic, a little mystery.  I just don't see how you can not be interested in this.	Ses01M-script02-07-01-1_M032.wav	07
Ses01M_script02_1_M040	 Out there, there's like this big mass of silver fish they're heading this way...	Ses01M-script02-07-01-1_M040.wav	07
Ses04F_impro03_F007	 Well actually we were just talking about today and I don't really want to do like the traditional church thing, you know.  So we are going to get married in the meadow.	Ses04F-impro03-07-01-F007.wav	07
Ses01M_script02_2_M002	 Look at this, my hairs are standing up my arm. I'm giving myself goose bumps.	Ses01M-script02-07-01-2_M002.wav	07
Ses04F_impro03_F034	 Throw in a little- little, uh, trim in yellow.  Maybe some yellow flowers.	Ses04F-impro03-07-01-F034.wav	07
Ses01M_script03_2_F015	 Don't be stupid, what?	Ses01M-script03-05-01-2_F015.wav	05
Ses04F_impro03_F043	 I know.  I've been waiting forever.  I can't believe it's finally happening.	Ses04F-impro03-07-01-F043.wav	07
Ses01M_script03_2_F025	 Oh, mind you own business.	Ses01M-script03-05-01-2_F025.wav	05
Ses01M_script03_2_F033	 They are away in Tunis.	Ses01M-script03-05-01-2_F033.wav	05
Ses04F_impro03_M005	 I'm invited, right.	Ses04F-impro03-07-01-M005.wav	07
Ses04F_impro03_M014	 Yeah.  I'll help plan.	Ses04F-impro03-07-01-M014.wav	07
Ses04F_impro03_M036	 Well this is really exciting.  I mean- I just- I couldn't be happier right now.	Ses04F-impro03-07-01-M036.wav	07
Ses04F_impro03_M039	 You're my best friend, we're growing up and now you're getting married. that's amazing	Ses04F-impro03-07-01-M039.wav	07
Ses01M_script03_2_M022	 You know, it's a pity you didn't have any more brandy. It would have made you just a little less disagreeable.	Ses01M-script03-05-01-2_M022.wav	05
Ses04F_impro04_M002	 Just, I don't know, maybe you're not smart enough.	Ses04F-impro04-01-01-M002.wav	01
Ses04F_impro04_M004	 I don't know.	Ses04F-impro04-01-01-M004.wav	01
Ses01M_script03_2_M029	 I think I told you once before that I had three minute liquor glasses the whole evening long.  A Child of two cannot get drunk on that.	Ses01M-script03-05-01-2_M029.wav	05
Ses01M_script03_2_M034	 This is no time a year for Tunis.	Ses01M-script03-05-01-2_M034.wav	05
Ses04F_impro04_M013	 I mean, well I mean i don't know; it doesn't really affect my life, you know.	Ses04F-impro04-01-01-M013.wav	01
Ses04F_impro04_M015	 I don't know. Well like, I don't know. I mean-	Ses04F-impro04-01-01-M015.wav	01

Ses04F_impro04_F011	 Clearly everything you're doing is completely wrong.	Ses04F-impro04-05-01-F011.wav	05
Ses02F_impro01_M019	 You know, Official documentation--	Ses02F-impro01-05-01-M019.wav	05

Ses04F_impro05_F006	 because my bag was very easy to keep track of.  It's got big, you know, rainbow colored crap all over it and no one was paying attention because now it's just gone.	Ses04F-impro05-05-01-F006.wav	05
Ses04F_impro05_F008	 No. No. I heard- I heard what you said.	Ses04F-impro05-05-01-F008.wav	05
Ses02F_impro02_F007	 and--I mean, my daughter--I don't want to put her in danger.  You know?  She has to stay.	Ses02F-impro02-04-01-F007.wav	04
Ses04F_impro05_F016	 I want to talk to your supervisor.	Ses04F-impro05-05-01-F016.wav	05
Ses02F_impro03_M014	 That's great.  Yeah.	Ses02F-impro03-01-01-M014.wav	01
Ses04F_impro06_M007	 It's sort of- it's almost better off to rest in peace than he is to live in pain.	Ses04F-impro06-01-01-M007.wav	01
Ses02F_impro03_M016	 Uh, huh. I mean, you know, it's spring--It'll be--	Ses02F-impro03-01-01-M016.wav	01
Ses04F_impro06_M009	 It's not fair but I mean that's, you know, the course of life is that, you know, you meet people and you lose them.	Ses04F-impro06-04-01-M009.wav	04
Ses02F_impro04_M003	 No, come on.  Don't [GARBAGE]	Ses02F-impro04-01-01-M003.wav	01

Ses02F_impro05_M002	 Uh, well some-some of the bags were--were lost on the way over here. uh-	Ses02F-impro05-01-01-M002.wav	01
Ses04F_impro07_M063	 Dorky?	Ses04F-impro07-01-01-M063.wav	01
Ses02F_impro05_M007	 I think, um, maybe you can file a claim if you want and turn it in to our main office--	Ses02F-impro05-01-01-M007.wav	01
Ses04F_impro07_F002	 From U.S.C..	Ses04F-impro07-07-01-F002.wav	07

Ses02F_impro06_M004	 I mean, you know, at least he's not in anymore pain now, right?	Ses02F-impro06-01-01-M004.wav	01
Ses02F_impro06_M008	 I mean--I don't know.	Ses02F-impro06-01-01-M008.wav	01
Ses02F_impro06_M009	 Well, that's that's good, you know.  At least, I don't know.  I mean it's- it's better to go- to goout that way than...	Ses02F-impro06-01-01-M009.wav	01
Ses02F_impro06_M011	 But look at the--he--look at the life he did get to lead.  I mean, for his age, he'd done so much and--	Ses02F-impro06-01-01-M011.wav	01
Ses04F_impro07_F022	 And it's so close so you can come visit me all the time.	Ses04F-impro07-07-01-F022.wav	07

Ses02F_impro07_F011	 And you know what, you know what I mean, like it's recognizable rather than just being like I went some random school. It's like people really know what you...	Ses02F-impro07-07-01-F011.wav	07
Ses02F_impro07_F021	 Well, you know, I've thought about it but they have so many things that I might--Like try some things out first...	Ses02F-impro07-07-01-F021.wav	07

Ses04F_script01_1_M004	 No, I figured the best thing was to leave him alone.	Ses04F-script01-04-01-1_M004.wav	04
Ses02F_impro08_F009	 All I'm going to need is your credit card number but just give me one moment. So-	Ses02F-impro08-01-01-F009.wav	01
Ses02F_impro08_F010	 um, you're scheduling a flight as well--And you would like to, um, we have a highly discounted hotel rate that goes along with that so that everything is all in one deal.  You're taken care of by the time that you get there.	Ses02F-impro08-01-01-F010.wav	01

Ses04F_script01_3_M043	 when you drive the new car, you have to know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've got to be a little better because of that.	Ses04F-script01-04-01-3_M043.wav	04
Ses02F_impro08_M006	 [BREATHING] that's good.	Ses02F-impro08-01-01-M006.wav	01
Ses02F_impro08_M008	 Okay. So--	Ses02F-impro08-01-01-M008.wav	01
Ses02F_impro08_M009	 Well, you know, we wanted to--we wanted to go to Maui and--That was a	Ses02F-impro08-01-01-M009.wav	01
Ses02F_impro08_M010	 --you know, the kids wanna go to the beach and stuff and so--um	Ses02F-impro08-01-01-M010.wav	01

Ses02F_script01_1_M040	 Yes, on this I would.	Ses02F-script01-01-01-1_M040.wav	01
Ses02F_script01_1_M043	 I am thinkin' that way.	Ses02F-script01-01-01-1_M043.wav	01
Ses04F_script01_1_M009	 You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?	Ses04F-script01-05-01-1_M009.wav	05
Ses04F_script01_1_M013	 For God's sake three years.  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane.	Ses04F-script01-05-01-1_M013.wav	05
Ses04F_script01_1_M028	 and then we'll thrash it out with dad, right mom.  Don't avoid me.	Ses04F-script01-05-01-1_M028.wav	05
Ses02F_script01_1_F004	 Did you talk to him?	Ses02F-script01-04-01-1_F004.wav	04
Ses04F_script01_1_M029	 So what I'm not fast with women.	Ses04F-script01-05-01-1_M029.wav	05
Ses02F_script01_1_F006	 What was he doing out here at that hour?	Ses02F-script01-04-01-1_F006.wav	04
Ses02F_script01_1_F017	 I've got an idea, but what's the story?	Ses02F-script01-04-01-1_F017.wav	04
Ses04F_script01_1_M034	 I've given it three years of thought.  I hoped that if I waited, dad would forget about Larry	Ses04F-script01-05-01-1_M034.wav	05
Ses04F_script01_2_F005	 What's going on here, Joe?	Ses04F-script01-05-01-2_F005.wav	05
Ses02F_script01_3_F021	 You've gotta tell me.	Ses02F-script01-04-01-3_F021.wav	04
Ses04F_script02_1_F000	 Fine.	Ses04F-script02-01-01-1_F000.wav	01
Ses04F_script02_1_M010	 Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  We should have brought the blanket, our blanket.	Ses04F-script02-01-01-1_M010.wav	01
Ses04F_script02_2_F008	 We totally skipped. Right.	Ses04F-script02-01-01-2_F008.wav	01
Ses02F_script01_3_M025	 Just about all.	Ses02F-script01-04-01-3_M025.wav	04
Ses02F_script01_3_M028	 They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today.	Ses02F-script01-04-01-3_M028.wav	04
Ses02F_script01_3_M030	 You know what I mean?  To show that, to bring that onto the Earth again, like some kind of monument and everyone would feel it standing behind him and it would make a difference to him.	Ses02F-script01-04-01-3_M030.wav	04
Ses02F_script01_3_M031	 Then I came back and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them seemed like sort of a bus accident.  I went to work with Dad and that rat race again.	Ses02F-script01-04-01-3_M031.wav	04
Ses04F_script02_2_F021	 right into my ear so that I could hear them as much as- so that I could feel them as much as hear them.	Ses04F-script02-04-01-2_F021.wav	04
Ses04F_script02_2_F026	 No.	Ses04F-script02-04-01-2_F026.wav	04
Ses04F_script02_2_M041	 No, I know but still.  I know I don't make you happy.	Ses04F-script02-04-01-2_M041.wav	04
Ses04F_script02_1_F013	 Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach, flop around, and then swim away and then they die.	Ses04F-script02-05-01-1_F013.wav	05
Ses02F_script01_2_F005	 It's got that all about it.	Ses02F-script01-05-01-2_F005.wav	05
Ses02F_script01_2_F012	 Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.  I mean, laugh--laugh at me, but...	Ses02F-script01-05-01-2_F012.wav	05
Ses02F_script02_1_F001	 What flashlight?	Ses02F-script02-01-01-1_F001.wav	01
Ses04F_script02_2_F006	 We just have different ideas about what this evening is supposed to look like.	Ses04F-script02-05-01-2_F006.wav	05
Ses02F_script02_1_F021	 About what?	Ses02F-script02-01-01-1_F021.wav	01
Ses02F_script02_2_M002	 It certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.	Ses02F-script02-01-01-2_M002.wav	01
Ses02F_script02_2_M017	 Okay, so I'm putting on my jacket, putting out the animals, getting the car out of the garage--	Ses02F-script02-01-01-2_M017.wav	01
Ses04F_script03_1_M009	 Don't say that, my darling.	Ses04F-script03-01-01-1_M009.wav	01
Ses02F_script02_2_M022	 You want me to go get some champagne?	Ses02F-script02-01-01-2_M022.wav	01
Ses04F_script03_1_M029	 Horrible thing.  I hated it.	Ses04F-script03-01-01-1_M029.wav	01
Ses02F_script02_2_M033	 Yes, it is.	Ses02F-script02-01-01-2_M033.wav	01
Ses02F_script02_2_M034	 Right.	Ses02F-script02-01-01-2_M034.wav	01
Ses02F_script02_2_F016	 I thought I was pregnant, you had a bottle of champagne, but no glasses.  You asked me to dance, so we kicked off our shoes and you popped the cork.	Ses02F-script02-04-01-2_F016.wav	04
Ses04F_script03_2_F014	 What?	Ses04F-script03-05-01-2_F014.wav	05
Ses02F_script02_2_M035	 I know, me neither.	Ses02F-script02-04-01-2_M035.wav	04
Ses04F_script03_2_F029	 Not very funny, dear.  You'd better have some more brandy.	Ses04F-script03-05-01-2_F029.wav	05
Ses04F_script03_2_F034	 Very well if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.	Ses04F-script03-05-01-2_F034.wav	05
Ses04F_script03_2_F037	 Listen? Listen indeed.  I'm sick and tired of listening to you.  You damn sadistic bully.	Ses04F-script03-05-01-2_F037.wav	05
Ses04F_script03_2_F038	 Stop.	Ses04F-script03-05-01-2_F038.wav	05
Ses04F_script03_2_F040	 This is the end do you understand?  The end,	Ses04F-script03-05-01-2_F040.wav	05
Ses04F_script03_2_M007	 What about me?	Ses04F-script03-05-01-2_M007.wav	05
Ses02F_script02_1_M026	 this is a big night for these guys.  Life's last orgy.	Ses02F-script02-07-01-1_M026.wav	07
Ses04F_script03_2_M039	 Amanda, listen.	Ses04F-script03-05-01-2_M039.wav	05
Ses04F_script03_2_M040	 Very amusing.	Ses04F-script03-05-01-2_M040.wav	05
Ses02F_script03_1_F014	 Well how long will it last us, this ludicrous overbearing love of ours.	Ses02F-script03-01-01-1_F014.wav	01
Ses02F_script03_1_F015	 Well, shall we always want to bicker and fight?	Ses02F-script03-01-01-1_F015.wav	01
Ses04F_script03_2_M043	 You're not.	Ses04F-script03-05-01-2_M043.wav	05
Ses04F_script03_1_F005	 Ahh.  It sent shivers up my spine.	Ses04F-script03-07-01-1_F005.wav	07
Ses02F_script03_1_M008	 Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy.  Do they?	Ses02F-script03-01-01-1_M008.wav	01
Ses02F_script03_1_M009	 Oh, darling, don't say that.	Ses02F-script03-01-01-1_M009.wav	01
Ses02F_script03_1_M010	 Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing, love?	Ses02F-script03-01-01-1_M010.wav	01
Ses02F_script03_1_M014	 Flippancy brings out the acid in their damn sweetness and light.	Ses02F-script03-01-01-1_M014.wav	01
Ses02F_script03_1_M015	 Certainly, you must.  We're figures of fun, alright.	Ses02F-script03-01-01-1_M015.wav	01
Ses02F_script03_1_M016	 Who knows.	Ses02F-script03-01-01-1_M016.wav	01
Ses04F_script03_1_F029	 How ridiculous.  How utterly, utterly ridiculous.	Ses04F-script03-07-01-1_F029.wav	07
Ses02F_script03_1_M018	 Depends on how well we've played.	Ses02F-script03-01-01-1_M018.wav	01
Ses02F_script03_1_M021	 So is everyone else in the long run.	Ses02F-script03-01-01-1_M021.wav	01
Ses02F_script03_1_M024	 I don't care what you do.  See, you could paint yourself green and dance naked in the Place Vendome and rush off madly with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word.  As long as you love me best.	Ses02F-script03-01-01-1_M024.wav	01
Ses02F_script03_1_M025	 You remember that awful scene we had in Venice?	Ses02F-script03-01-01-1_M025.wav	01
Ses04M_impro01_F012	 twenty bucks? Please. Go get in that line over there.	Ses04M-impro01-01-01-F012.wav	01
Ses02F_script03_1_M033	 We were very much younger then.	Ses02F-script03-01-01-1_M033.wav	01
Ses02F_script03_1_M034	 As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.	Ses02F-script03-01-01-1_M034.wav	01
Ses02F_script03_2_F011	 Just seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing.	Ses02F-script03-01-01-2_F011.wav	01
Ses04M_impro02_M008	 There's nothing I can do.  I mean, I have to go.	Ses04M-impro02-01-01-M008.wav	01
Ses02F_script03_2_F020	 Adders don't snap, they sting.	Ses02F-script03-05-01-2_F020.wav	05
Ses04M_impro03_F004	 Did she cry?	Ses04M-impro03-07-01-F004.wav	07
Ses02F_script03_2_F034	 Turn it on again, please.	Ses02F-script03-05-01-2_F034.wav	05
Ses04M_impro03_F007	 Yeah, it is.	Ses04M-impro03-07-01-F007.wav	07

Ses04M_impro03_F019	 It's fantastic.  I -- congratulations. It's amazing.	Ses04M-impro03-07-01-F019.wav	07
Ses02F_script03_2_M027	 I'm not in the least drunk.	Ses02F-script03-05-01-2_M027.wav	05
Ses04M_impro03_M011	 Okay. Well there you go.	Ses04M-impro03-07-01-M011.wav	07

Ses02F_script03_2_M043	 You're not.	Ses02F-script03-05-01-2_M043.wav	05
Ses04M_impro04_F002	 Have you gone, like, signed up with a temp agency?  Maybe they can help.	Ses04M-impro04-01-01-F002.wav	01
Ses04M_impro04_F005	 Well, I mean, if it's that bad, maybe you're gonna have to take something that doesn't really fit, you know.  Like maybe you'll have to do something else for a while.  Find a new field, new skill.	Ses04M-impro04-01-01-F005.wav	01
Ses02F_script03_2_M047	 You're a evil vampire and I hope to God I never see you again as long as I live.	Ses02F-script03-05-01-2_M047.wav	05
Ses02F_script03_1_M032	 Oh, I'll never forget his face.	Ses02F-script03-07-01-1_M032.wav	07

Ses02M_impro03_M001	 Well, I finally did it	Ses02M-impro03-07-01-M001.wav	07
Ses04M_impro06_M013	 there should just be some sort of rule that people don't die until they're older, 'cause then, at least, it's expected.	Ses04M-impro06-04-01-M013.wav	04
Ses04M_impro06_M016	 I hope it rains.  Somehow that'll make me feel more comfortable.	Ses04M-impro06-04-01-M016.wav	04

Ses02M_impro08_M014	 We could mail it to you as well, but-	Ses02M-impro08-01-01-M014.wav	01
Ses02M_impro08_M016	 and it'll get taken off um- no problem you know	Ses02M-impro08-01-01-M016.wav	01
Ses04M_script02_2_M001	 What I said.	Ses04M-script02-01-01-2_M001.wav	01
Ses02M_impro08_M022	 Yeah, yeah. Maybe we'll, uh-	Ses02M-impro08-01-01-M022.wav	01
Ses04M_script02_2_F020	 No.	Ses04M-script02-04-01-2_F020.wav	04

Ses04M_script02_2_F021	 No.	Ses04M-script02-04-01-2_F021.wav	04
Ses04M_script02_2_M037	 No, I know.  But still.  I know I don't make you happy.	Ses04M-script02-04-01-2_M037.wav	04
Ses04M_script02_1_F002	 It's not yours.	Ses04M-script02-05-01-1_F002.wav	05
Ses04M_script02_1_F004	 You kept saying my flashlight as if it's somehow just yours.  How is that supposed to make me feel?	Ses04M-script02-05-01-1_F004.wav	05
Ses02M_impro08_M029	 and never you know, give it to anyone out, never even give out your number to any like unreliable company that you haven't heard of or anything like that, all right? Because, um, we want to- we definitely want to help you out, but-	Ses02M-impro08-01-01-M029.wav	01
Ses04M_script02_1_F008	 There is no point in coming down here.	Ses04M-script02-05-01-1_F008.wav	05
Ses02M_impro08_F000	 Hi. Thank you so much, you're a real person, right, you're not like a recording?	Ses02M-impro08-07-01-F000.wav	07
Ses04M_script02_2_F009	 We never do, do we?  Have we ever?	Ses04M-script02-05-01-2_F009.wav	05
Ses04M_script02_2_F025	 No.	Ses04M-script02-05-01-2_F025.wav	05
Ses02M_script01_2_M004	 How do you know he's even thinking of it?	Ses02M-script01-01-01-2_M004.wav	01
Ses02M_script01_2_M007	 You can't read her mind.	Ses02M-script01-01-01-2_M007.wav	01
Ses04M_script02_1_M002	 Is that, is that - is that just foam?  I can't even tell.  Although, if you can't tell, it's probably isn't them.  It'll probably be unmistakable, don't you think?	Ses04M-script02-07-01-1_M002.wav	07
Ses02M_script01_3_F021	 It wouldn't work this way.	Ses02M-script01-04-01-3_F021.wav	04
Ses04M_script02_1_M033	 Well so what did you think?	Ses04M-script02-07-01-1_M033.wav	07
Ses04M_script03_1_M003	 We'll be alright, darling.  Whatever happens, aren't we?	Ses04M-script03-01-01-1_M003.wav	01
Ses02M_script01_3_M028	 For instance, this one time, it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks.  I put them in pocket.  It's only a little thing, but those are the kind of guys I had.	Ses02M-script01-04-01-3_M028.wav	04
Ses02M_script01_3_M029	 They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  I mean, a little more selfish and they'd have been here today.	Ses02M-script01-04-01-3_M029.wav	04
Ses04M_script03_2_M009	 Line?	Ses04M-script03-01-01-2_M009.wav	01
Ses04M_script03_1_M016	 No.  That fire will fade along with our passion.	Ses04M-script03-04-01-1_M016.wav	04
Ses04M_script03_1_M013	 All the futile moralists who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.  Laugh at everything.  All their sacred shibboleths.  Flippancy brings out the acid- acid in their damn sweetness and light.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-1_M013.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_F000	 That was the first time you ever hit me.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_F000.wav	05
Ses02M_script01_1_F037	 Well, you don't want to think like that.	Ses02M-script01-05-01-1_F037.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_F019	 What?	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_F019.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_F028	 I don't care.  Do you understand?  I don't care.  I don't mind if they bark and roll about like hoops.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_F028.wav	05
Ses02M_script01_1_M037	 I've been a good son too long a good sucker, I'm through with it.	Ses02M-script01-05-01-1_M037.wav	05
Ses02M_script01_1_M039	 Yes, I like it and hour a day. If I'm going to grub for money all day long, at least in the evening I want it beautiful.	Ses02M-script01-05-01-1_M039.wav	05
Ses02M_script01_2_F000	 Why did he invite her here?	Ses02M-script01-05-01-2_F000.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_F034	 Oh, shut up.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_F034.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_F040	 Very well, if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_F040.wav	05
Ses02M_script01_2_M016	 What does that mean, me above all?	Ses02M-script01-05-01-2_M016.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_F041	 Go away.  Go away.  I hate you.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_F041.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_F046	 Stop.  I hate you.  Do you hear me? You're conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_F046.wav	05
Ses02M_script02_1_F001	 What flashlight?	Ses02M-script02-01-01-1_F001.wav	01
Ses02M_script02_1_F006	 I'm cold.	Ses02M-script02-01-01-1_F006.wav	01
Ses04M_script03_2_M012	 What about me?	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M012.wav	05
Ses02M_script02_2_M010	 Well, we'll see them this year.	Ses02M-script02-01-01-2_M010.wav	01
Ses02M_script02_2_M015	 You were fine during the phone call from Marge, dinner was okay, doing the dishes was no problem, let's see, I took a shower, you watched the news, you said	Ses02M-script02-01-01-2_M015.wav	01
Ses04M_script03_2_M024	 As a matter of fact, that's perfectly true.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M024.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_M025	 Yes, it is.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M025.wav	05
Ses02M_script02_1_F016	 I'm just not.	Ses02M-script02-04-01-1_F016.wav	04
Ses04M_script03_2_M034	 You must have had a riotous time.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M034.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_M035	 No restraint at all, very enjoyable.  You never had much anyhow.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M035.wav	05
Ses02M_script02_2_F020	 I'd rather not remember some things. I would rather not hope for some things.	Ses02M-script02-04-01-2_F020.wav	04
Ses04M_script03_2_M040	 Very good idea.  I will	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M040.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_M049	 You're a vile tempered, loosed living	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M049.wav	05
Ses02M_script02_2_M037	 Maybe if you were with somebody else too.	Ses02M-script02-04-01-2_M037.wav	04
Ses02M_script02_2_F006	 We just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like.	Ses02M-script02-05-01-2_F006.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_M056	 Whore.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M056.wav	05
Ses02M_script02_2_F013	 I did want to see them, I always do. I mean I keep thinking that this is going to be the time and it never is.	Ses02M-script02-05-01-2_F013.wav	05
Ses02M_script02_2_M029	 Well welcome to the human race, all right. Do you think this is what I had in mind when I proposed? You think I had this great fantasy going that four years down the road we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish?	Ses02M-script02-05-01-2_M029.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_1_F008	 But what's so horrible is that one can't stay happy.	Ses04M-script03-07-01-1_F008.wav	07
Ses04M_script03_1_F009	 It's true.  The whole business is a very poor joke.	Ses04M-script03-07-01-1_F009.wav	07
Ses02M_script02_1_M004	 Is that -- is that, no? Was that just foam? I can't even tell.	Ses02M-script02-07-01-1_M004.wav	07
Ses02M_script02_1_M014	 Oh, a six-pack, that's, should've brought a -- a six-pack be just the ticket right now. How could I forget,	Ses02M-script02-07-01-1_M014.wav	07
Ses02M_script02_1_M015	 oh man. Like a kid, it's amazing I got out of the house with my fly zipped.	Ses02M-script02-07-01-1_M015.wav	07
Ses04M_script03_1_F026	 It burnt my comb, too, and all the towels in the bathroom.	Ses04M-script03-07-01-1_F026.wav	07
Ses04M_script03_1_F028	 The manager came in and found is rolling about on the floor, biting and scratching like panthers.  Oh, dear.	Ses04M-script03-07-01-1_F028.wav	07
Ses04M_script03_1_M006	 What shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us?	Ses04M-script03-07-01-1_M006.wav	07
Ses04M_script03_1_M007	 With the mo- with the most perfect poise?	Ses04M-script03-07-01-1_M007.wav	07
Ses04M_script03_1_M021	 Let's savor the delight of the moment.  Come and kiss me, darling, before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.	Ses04M-script03-07-01-1_M021.wav	07
Ses02M_script02_1_M042	 Look at me; I'm giving myself goose bumps all my hairs are popping up.	Ses02M-script02-07-01-1_M042.wav	07
Ses02M_script02_2_M019	 It was in the car, right? Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker you said, let's get some champagne and I said times are wasting or something like that, right?	Ses02M-script02-07-01-2_M019.wav	07
Ses05F_impro01_F000	 Hi, I need an ID.	Ses05F-impro01-01-01-F000.wav	01
Ses05F_impro01_F017	 Isn't there anything you can do?  Just call over and ask them if I can go to the front of the line in the other line.	Ses05F-impro01-05-01-F017.wav	05
Ses02M_script03_2_F024	 Yes, I did quite a lot.	Ses02M-script03-01-01-2_F024.wav	01
Ses02M_script03_2_M012	 You can hardly call three liquor glasses in a whole evening going on and on and on.	Ses02M-script03-01-01-2_M012.wav	01
Ses05F_impro02_F012	 I think infantry.  I'm not sure.	Ses05F-impro02-04-01-F012.wav	04
Ses05F_impro02_F032	 You'll have to send me pictures and letters everyday.	Ses05F-impro02-04-01-F032.wav	04
Ses02M_script03_2_F023	 I don't care. Do you understand? I don't care. I don't care if they bark or roll about like hoops.	Ses02M-script03-05-01-2_F023.wav	05
Ses05F_impro02_F035	 "sigh" Three weeks.	Ses05F-impro02-04-01-F035.wav	04
Ses02M_script03_2_F037	 Listen indeed. I'm sick and tired of listening to you, damn sadistic bully.	Ses02M-script03-05-01-2_F037.wav	05
Ses02M_script03_2_F038	 Stop it. Stop it. I hate you, do you hear? You're overbearing and conceited and utterly impossible.	Ses02M-script03-05-01-2_F038.wav	05
Ses05F_impro02_M025	 It's not fair.	Ses05F-impro02-04-01-M025.wav	04
Ses02M_script03_2_F041	 Yes, I am. Let go of me you're cruel fiend and I hate and loathe you. Thank God I realized who you really are before I would ever, ever marry you again. I would never marry you again. I'd rather die in torment.	Ses02M-script03-05-01-2_F041.wav	05
