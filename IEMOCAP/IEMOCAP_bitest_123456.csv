Ses05F_impro07_M018	 We should try to find, like, a party spot though, like you know where there's going to be a lot of parties, where there are cool people, though.  Do you know any people that might be out there?	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-M018.wav	07
Ses05F_impro07_M025	 I know exactly how you feel about that. I think you feel really excited about it.  I know you are. I can tell. I know you.	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-M025.wav	07

Ses05F_impro08_F017	 Okay, I do see that on here, and it says that um, it had some trouble clearing for some reason.  And I think that was the problem on our end.  So um-	Ses05F-impro08-01-01-F017.wav	01
Ses05F_impro08_F018	 Well you know sometimes-- just with online transactions, things happens. so um-	Ses05F-impro08-01-01-F018.wav	01
Ses01F_impro04_M011	 I don't know.  He had a really good resume I guess and--	Ses01F-impro04-01-01-M011.wav	01
Ses01F_impro04_M013	 It's kind of helpful when getting a job.	Ses01F-impro04-01-01-M013.wav	01
Ses05F_impro08_F023	 Right, right, and since--yeah, since it was just a computer glitch, then that's that should be cleared up as well.  So I'm going to go ahead and try and put that into the computer.  And if for some reason you notice on your statement in a few days that you've been charged and an overdue fee, then you should just call back and we'll have that.	Ses05F-impro08-01-01-F023.wav	01
Ses01F_impro04_M016	 Yeah.  But the piece of paper helps, too.	Ses01F-impro04-01-01-M016.wav	01
