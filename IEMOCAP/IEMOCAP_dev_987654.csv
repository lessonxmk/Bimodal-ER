Ses05M_script02_1_M030	 somewhere out there is a giant mass of silver fish all swimming in this direction.  They don't know why they're doing it.  We don't know why they're doing it.  They didn't- It wasn't a decision.  No one took a vote.  Nobody sent them an invitation or a map or anything like that.  It was just some internal time release fire cracker that went off. And all as one they turned around and formed this giant line as long as the California coastline and they just started swimming.  They are swimming right now at this very moment.   And And-	Ses05M-script02-07-01-1_M030.wav	07

Ses05F_script01_2_M017	 What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you, Kate?	Ses05F-script01-05-01-2_M017.wav	05
Ses02F_impro07_M001	 Oh, you got what?  Where?	Ses02F-impro07-07-01-M001.wav	07
Ses04M_script02_2_F013	 I did want to see it.  I always do.  I keep thinking this time will be the time, but it never is.	Ses04M-script02-05-01-2_F013.wav	05
Ses03M_impro02_F017	 I'm sick of being strong-- --for us.	Ses03M-impro02-04-01-F017.wav	04
Ses04M_script03_2_F039	 Turn it on again, please.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_F039.wav	05
Ses05M_impro03_M021	 It will be perfect.	Ses05M-impro03-07-01-M021.wav	07
Ses02M_script01_1_M004	 No. I figured it was best to leave him alone.	Ses02M-script01-04-01-1_M004.wav	04
Ses01M_script01_1_M004	 No.  I figured I'd just let it wait.	Ses01M-script01-04-01-1_M004.wav	04
Ses02M_script02_1_M000	 What time is it? They're supposed to run around midnight.	Ses02M-script02-07-01-1_M000.wav	07
Ses03M_impro03_F018	 Isn't it a rat?  It's a rat.  Chuck E. Cheese?	Ses03M-impro03-01-01-F018.wav	01
Ses05M_impro07_M032	 Really?	Ses05M-impro07-07-01-M032.wav	07
Ses05F_script01_1_M008	 Being dishonest with him.  It's the kind of thing that pays off and now it's paying off.	Ses05F-script01-04-01-1_M008.wav	04
Ses01F_impro01_F000	 Excuse me.	Ses01F-impro01-01-01-F000.wav	01
Ses04F_script02_1_M040	 Ah, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  All my hairs are popping up.	Ses04F-script02-07-01-1_M040.wav	07
Ses03M_impro05b_F028	 We can have them direct your luggage to San Diego.	Ses03M-impro05b-01-01-F028.wav	01
Ses03M_impro06_M007	 Yeah.	Ses03M-impro06-04-01-M007.wav	04
Ses02M_impro08_M002	 Right. No, yes I know. It is-It is a little frustrating.	Ses02M-impro08-01-01-M002.wav	01
Ses03M_script02_1_M003	 Is that, is that, nah, is that just Paul?  I can't even tell.	Ses03M-script02-07-01-1_M003.wav	07
Ses05M_impro02_F023	 okay.	Ses05M-impro02-04-01-F023.wav	04
Ses05M_impro08_M001	 This happens every two weeks?	Ses05M-impro08-01-01-M001.wav	01
Ses02F_script03_2_M009	 Me, too.  Bored stiff.  You want some brandy?	Ses02F-script03-01-01-2_M009.wav	01
Ses02M_impro05_F001	 Oh, did you check? Did you make sure as it went around the second time that it-	Ses02M-impro05-01-01-F001.wav	01
Ses02F_script03_1_M009	 Oh, darling, don't say that.	Ses02F-script03-01-01-1_M009.wav	01
Ses03F_script03_1_F009	 Don't laugh at me. I'm serious.	Ses03F-script03-07-01-1_F009.wav	07
Ses05F_impro07_F005	 I'll stay in town.	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-F005.wav	07
Ses05F_impro04_M005	 You have to be willing - You have to be willing to start you know at the bottom and work your way up. and	Ses05F-impro04-01-01-M005.wav	01
Ses04F_impro06_M011	 You know I think- I think we should celebrate because I think that's what he would have wanted.	Ses04F-impro06-04-01-M011.wav	04
Ses04F_script01_1_F011	 What do you want to do, argue with him?	Ses04F-script01-05-01-1_F011.wav	05
Ses01M_script01_1_F032	 Do you know what that'll do to you, to your father, do you know?  I don't.	Ses01M-script01-05-01-1_F032.wav	05
Ses03M_script01_1_M017	 You know why I asked Annie here, right?	Ses03M-script01-01-01-1_M017.wav	01
Ses05M_impro05_F004	 So, within the country, though? umm	Ses05M-impro05-01-01-F004.wav	01
Ses05M_script03_1_M008	 Uhh, It's amazing how once you feel--	Ses05M-script03-07-01-1_M008.wav	07
Ses04M_script02_1_M002	 Is that, is that - is that just foam?  I can't even tell.  Although, if you can't tell, it's probably isn't them.  It'll probably be unmistakable, don't you think?	Ses04M-script02-07-01-1_M002.wav	07
Ses01F_impro04_F033	 I can not-- you are not here by choice.  Nobody would ride this bus by choice.	Ses01F-impro04-05-01-F033.wav	05
Ses05F_script03_1_F030	 And then the manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor biting and scratching like panthers.	Ses05F-script03-07-01-1_F030.wav	07
Ses04F_script03_1_F005	 Ahh.  It sent shivers up my spine.	Ses04F-script03-07-01-1_F005.wav	07
Ses02F_script02_2_F011	 I mean, I feel like my whole life is gonna be spent standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for the fish to show up.  And the fish won't show up.	Ses02F-script02-05-01-2_F011.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_F031	 You're quite insufferable.  I expected it's because you're drunk.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_F031.wav	05
Ses02F_impro01_F021	 Who--you always use your driver's license.  I mean, you're not coming to the D.M.V. if you're not over sixteen and that's when you get your driver's license so you're never gonna need it anyway.	Ses02F-impro01-05-01-F021.wav	05
Ses03M_impro06_M020	 and then something like this happens you know?	Ses03M-impro06-04-01-M020.wav	04
Ses04F_impro04_F000	 That's helpful.	Ses04F-impro04-01-01-F000.wav	01
Ses05M_impro07_M037	 So it comes Indian like. And you know I'm kind of smart, so.	Ses05M-impro07-07-01-M037.wav	07
Ses05M_impro07_M003	 I know. I know.  I'm so excited.	Ses05M-impro07-07-01-M003.wav	07
Ses04M_script03_2_M047	 Turn it off.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M047.wav	05
Ses01M_script02_2_F000	 That's the wind.	Ses01M-script02-01-01-2_F000.wav	01
Ses05M_script01_3_M001	 So, you're not sorry I came?	Ses05M-script01-07-01-3_M001.wav	07
Ses02F_impro01_M004	 um Sorry.	Ses02F-impro01-01-01-M004.wav	01
Ses03F_script03_1_F014	 Oh dear, well, shall we want that?	Ses03F-script03-04-01-1_F014.wav	04
Ses01M_impro06_F010	 Oh. Really fast? Oh.	Ses01M-impro06-01-01-F010.wav	01
Ses01M_script01_3_M018	 I kissed you.  I kissed Annie.	Ses01M-script01-07-01-3_M018.wav	07
Ses04F_script03_2_F024	 Mind your own business.	Ses04F-script03-05-01-2_F024.wav	05
Ses02F_script01_1_M017	 I'm gonna ask her to marry me.	Ses02F-script01-01-01-1_M017.wav	01
Ses01F_script03_2_F026	 On the contrary, a child of two can get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.	Ses01F-script03-05-01-2_F026.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_M014	 So am I; bored stiff.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M014.wav	05
Ses01F_script01_3_F005	 And then, you.  You've been kind of...	Ses01F-script01-01-01-3_F005.wav	01
Ses05F_impro03_M003	 No way.	Ses05F-impro03-07-01-M003.wav	07
Ses04F_script03_2_F021	 They sting.	Ses04F-script03-05-01-2_F021.wav	05
Ses03F_script01_1_M021	 See, then it's not just my business. God, you have	Ses03F-script01-05-01-1_M021.wav	05
Ses02M_impro06_F014	 It's going to be okay, I promise.	Ses02M-impro06-04-01-F014.wav	04
Ses05M_impro07_F012	 I know.  I know.  I'm- I'm definitely -- I realize [LAUGHTER].	Ses05M-impro07-07-01-F012.wav	07
Ses01F_impro06_F024	 And the last time before she died, I remember she couldn't really stand, umm...	Ses01F-impro06-04-01-F024.wav	04
Ses03M_impro05b_M015	 Of course I had my name tags on the luggage.	Ses03M-impro05b-05-01-M015.wav	05
Ses04F_script03_2_F020	 Adders don't snap they sting.	Ses04F-script03-05-01-2_F020.wav	05
Ses04F_impro07_M043	 Right, so we'll go there and then- and then we'll get some ice cream and maybe we'll go putt-putt golfing.	Ses04F-impro07-07-01-M043.wav	07
Ses01F_impro03_M016	 How much did he win at the slot?	Ses01F-impro03-01-01-M016.wav	01
Ses02M_script02_2_M035	 No, I know. Me neither.	Ses02M-script02-04-01-2_M035.wav	04
Ses02M_script02_1_M028	 Okay. But it's fish that do something none of the other fish do. Like the swallows returning to Capistrano, or the Lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs	Ses02M-script02-07-01-1_M028.wav	07
Ses04M_script02_2_F006	 Goddamn it, Augie, don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  You always ask me that.  It's insulting.	Ses04M-script02-05-01-2_F006.wav	05
Ses02M_impro02_M014	 and it'll work out you know, go there and do that. Yeah, I'll be back	Ses02M-impro02-01-01-M014.wav	01
Ses04M_script03_2_F037	 There aren't any people upstairs.  It's a photographer's studio.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_F037.wav	05
Ses05F_script02_2_F025	 This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.	Ses05F-script02-04-01-2_F025.wav	04
Ses04F_script01_3_M030	 It takes a lot of time to toss that off because they weren't just men.	Ses04F-script01-04-01-3_M030.wav	04
Ses04M_impro03_F016	 Big and shiny.  You're such a guy. [LAUGHTER]	Ses04M-impro03-07-01-F016.wav	07
Ses01F_script01_3_M028	 You can't just toss off a thing like that because they weren't just men. You know?	Ses01F-script01-04-01-3_M028.wav	04
Ses04F_impro04_F030	 What's my problem?  What's my problem? I don't have a job.	Ses04F-impro04-05-01-F030.wav	05
Ses03M_script01_1_F045	 I don't understand you do I?	Ses03M-script01-04-01-1_F045.wav	04
Ses01M_script02_2_F010	 Why do you ask me that?  God damn it, I told you not to ask me that I hate it when you ask me that. It's insulting.	Ses01M-script02-05-01-2_F010.wav	05
Ses02F_script02_2_F035	 I didn't say that.	Ses02F-script02-04-01-2_F035.wav	04
Ses04M_script01_1_M001	 He was out here when it broke.	Ses04M-script01-01-01-1_M001.wav	01
Ses04F_script01_1_M022	 Sometimes you have a- Sometimes you have a talent for ignoring things.	Ses04F-script01-05-01-1_M022.wav	05
Ses04F_impro07_F058	 Excellent.  Drive drunk people around because you know that's all campus cruisers for.	Ses04F-impro07-07-01-F058.wav	07
Ses05M_script01_3_M003	 Well-	Ses05M-script01-01-01-3_M003.wav	01
Ses03M_impro06_M027	 What the...what am I doing?	Ses03M-impro06-04-01-M027.wav	04
Ses04M_script01_1_M018	 Going to ask her to marry me.	Ses04M-script01-01-01-1_M018.wav	01
Ses01F_script03_2_F018	 You shut up.	Ses01F-script03-05-01-2_F018.wav	05
Ses03F_script03_1_M005	 Then I don't care.	Ses03F-script03-01-01-1_M005.wav	01
Ses02M_impro02_F001	 I'm going to miss you too; I don't know what I'm going to do here without you. It's going to be so lonely, and so hard.	Ses02M-impro02-04-01-F001.wav	04
Ses02M_impro03_M001	 Well, I finally did it	Ses02M-impro03-07-01-M001.wav	07
Ses02F_script01_3_M030	 You know what I mean?  To show that, to bring that onto the Earth again, like some kind of monument and everyone would feel it standing behind him and it would make a difference to him.	Ses02F-script01-04-01-3_M030.wav	04
Ses05F_impro01_F020	 Right, well, last time they told me, it was this line, and obviously, it's not true.	Ses05F-impro01-05-01-F020.wav	05
Ses05M_script02_1_M005	 Oh, no, of course, our flashlight.  Me flashlight is to you flashlight, naturally.	Ses05M-script02-07-01-1_M005.wav	07
Ses05F_script03_2_F030	 There aren't any people upstairs; it's a photographer's studio.	Ses05F-script03-05-01-2_F030.wav	05
Ses02M_impro05_M013	 But we have the tags on. I mean like it wouldn't you know, if it got stuck somewhere it's like well this is nobodies bag I mean maybe you know look on the tag and	Ses02M-impro05-05-01-M013.wav	05
Ses04F_impro03_F038	 because you're going to take care of everything.  You're going to think of all the details that I forget.	Ses04F-impro03-07-01-F038.wav	07
Ses03M_script03_2_M003	 You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.	Ses03M-script03-05-01-2_M003.wav	05
Ses02F_impro05_M018	 Well, that's--that's what I'm saying--	Ses02F-impro05-01-01-M018.wav	01
Ses01M_script01_1_M006	 I don't know.	Ses01M-script01-04-01-1_M006.wav	04
Ses01M_script03_1_M028	 Let's pity the poor philosophers, huh?  Let's enjoy the party for as long as we can, okay?  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and sit like small idiotic school children. [LAUGHTER]	Ses01M-script03-07-01-1_M028.wav	07
Ses03M_script02_2_F037	 I didn't say that.	Ses03M-script02-04-01-2_F037.wav	04
Ses03F_script01_1_M006	 I guess he is.	Ses03F-script01-01-01-1_M006.wav	01
Ses05M_impro03_F027	 Yeah, have you ever like lived with someone else before?	Ses05M-impro03-01-01-F027.wav	01
Ses03M_impro08a_M024	 All right um--	Ses03M-impro08a-01-01-M024.wav	01
Ses01F_impro07_M018	 Of course, right.  That's where the real money is, being a student.	Ses01F-impro07-01-01-M018.wav	01
Ses03M_impro06_M006	 He was supposed to be the best man at my wedding.	Ses03M-impro06-04-01-M006.wav	04
Ses05F_script03_2_F018	 Um, It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.	Ses05F-script03-05-01-2_F018.wav	05
Ses05M_script01_3_M041	 Oh, Annie,	Ses05M-script01-07-01-3_M041.wav	07
Ses02M_impro06_F009	 She really cared about you, you know.	Ses02M-impro06-04-01-F009.wav	04
Ses05M_script01_3_F025	 Because you can't feel like that anymore, Chris.  Because everything you have, you have a right to, me included.	Ses05M-script01-04-01-3_F025.wav	04
Ses02F_script03_2_M046	 I wouldn't marry you if you came in crawling on your knees	Ses02F-script03-05-01-2_M046.wav	05
Ses02M_script03_1_M018	 Yes, yes, with all his might.	Ses02M-script03-07-01-1_M018.wav	07
Ses03M_script03_2_F006	 Well it didn't harm him, in fact, it pleasured him a lot and it didn't hurt me.	Ses03M-script03-01-01-2_F006.wav	01
Ses03M_impro03_M001	 Esmeralda, guess what?	Ses03M-impro03-07-01-M001.wav	07
Ses04M_impro06_M015	 I mean, you- you can go.  I don't know.  I don't know what else.	Ses04M-impro06-04-01-M015.wav	04
Ses02F_script02_1_M017	 Do you want my jacket?	Ses02F-script02-01-01-1_M017.wav	01
Ses05M_impro02_M018	 I know.  But I'll-I'll send the pictures all the time and I'll write them emails and you can read them the emails that I send them.	Ses05M-impro02-04-01-M018.wav	04
Ses02F_impro08_F008	 I can do that right now for you. No, absolutely.  I can take care of you all the way through to the end.	Ses02F-impro08-01-01-F008.wav	01
Ses04M_script03_1_F021	 Thank you, dear.  The same applies to you, except that if I catch you so much as looking at another woman, I will kill you.	Ses04M-script03-07-01-1_F021.wav	07
Ses03F_impro06_F035	 I loved him so much.	Ses03F-impro06-04-01-F035.wav	04
Ses03M_script02_2_M021	 And you said let's get some champagne and I said time's a wasting or something like that.	Ses03M-script02-01-01-2_M021.wav	01
Ses01F_script03_2_M010	 I'll have a little, I think.	Ses01F-script03-01-01-2_M010.wav	01
Ses04M_script02_1_F010	 So let's go home.	Ses04M-script02-05-01-1_F010.wav	05
Ses01M_impro07_F009	 That is amazing, congratulations. Good for you.	Ses01M-impro07-07-01-F009.wav	07
Ses04F_script02_2_M043	 Actually now that you mention it, no I don't.	Ses04F-script02-01-01-2_M043.wav	01
Ses04F_script03_2_M003	 You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.	Ses04F-script03-05-01-2_M003.wav	05
Ses04M_impro07_F006	 Right.	Ses04M-impro07-07-01-F006.wav	07
Ses02M_impro04_F009	 I'm sorry.	Ses02M-impro04-04-01-F009.wav	04
Ses05F_impro06_M012	 Was he very close to his family?	Ses05F-impro06-01-01-M012.wav	01
Ses01F_impro06_M001	 Is there anything I can get you?  Do you want me to take care of anything for you or...?	Ses01F-impro06-01-01-M001.wav	01
Ses05M_script03_2_F015	 Just making myself fascinating for you.	Ses05M-script03-01-01-2_F015.wav	01
Ses05F_impro05_M019	 Well,	Ses05F-impro05-01-01-M019.wav	01
Ses02M_impro06_M002	 I guess we saw it coming and she lasted a lot - a lot longer than, uh, they expected but you know, I mean when it actually happens it's just a lot harder.	Ses02M-impro06-04-01-M002.wav	04
Ses04M_script03_2_M054	 You're a mean, evil minded	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M054.wav	05
Ses02M_script02_1_M025	 Yea, but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives. I mean all that flopping is laying eggs or what do you, mating or spotting or something like that.	Ses02M-script02-07-01-1_M025.wav	07
