Ses04M_impro06_M011	 This is just -- this is a terrible life.  I just don't understand.	Ses04M-impro06-04-01-M011.wav	04
Ses04F_script01_3_M031	 For instance, one time it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks.	Ses04F-script01-04-01-3_M031.wav	04
Ses03M_script03_2_F028	 Mind your business.	Ses03M-script03-05-01-2_F028.wav	05

Ses05M_impro06_M002	 The end, he's been sick for awhile.  He had cancer.	Ses05M-impro06-04-01-M002.wav	04
Ses03M_impro06_M018	 I was supposed to see him last summer	Ses03M-impro06-04-01-M018.wav	04
Ses01M_script01_1_F014	 What, can you prove it?  What proof do you have?  Can you prove it?	Ses01M-script01-05-01-1_F014.wav	05
Ses04M_impro08_F027	 I'll	Ses04M-impro08-01-01-F027.wav	01
Ses05M_script03_2_F038	 Stop.  Would you just go away?  I mean, you're conceited, and overbearing, and utterly impossible.	Ses05M-script03-05-01-2_F038.wav	05
Ses04F_script03_2_F044	 I'd rather die in torment. Beast.  Brute.  Calf swine.	Ses04F-script03-05-01-2_F044.wav	05
Ses05F_script03_2_F027	 Not very funny, dear, you better have some more brandy.	Ses05F-script03-05-01-2_F027.wav	05
Ses01F_script01_3_M036	 And I didn't want any of it. I guess that included you.	Ses01F-script01-04-01-3_M036.wav	04
Ses02F_script02_2_F000	 About what?	Ses02F-script02-01-01-2_F000.wav	01
Ses05M_script01_1_M022	 Isn't it your business, too, if dad -- if I tell dad and he throws a fit about it?  I mean, you have such a talent for ignoring things.	Ses05M-script01-05-01-1_M022.wav	05

Ses05M_script01_1_M025	 To hell with that!	Ses05M-script01-05-01-1_M025.wav	05
Ses05M_impro07_F026	 Yeah.  I mean, I know, I know, like the- the housing surrounding the campus pretty well.	Ses05M-impro07-01-01-F026.wav	01
Ses03F_impro02_F028	 What do you mean?	Ses03F-impro02-04-01-F028.wav	04
Ses03M_impro08b_F021	 Alright. Well-  I guess - I guess that's okay but,	Ses03M-impro08b-01-01-F021.wav	01
Ses03M_script01_1_M003	 I don't know. But after it cracked he ran back into the house and he cried in the kitchen.	Ses03M-script01-04-01-1_M003.wav	04
Ses01F_script02_2_M019	 It's when we were driving past that Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, let's get some champagne.  I said no, time's a wasting or something like that.	Ses01F-script02-01-01-2_M019.wav	01
Ses03F_script02_1_F012	 Pass up what? A bunch of fish. They swim up to the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die.	Ses03F-script02-05-01-1_F012.wav	05
Ses01M_script02_2_F032	 Oh, sure this is standing on the beach, this is waiting, fighting.	Ses01M-script02-05-01-2_F032.wav	05
Ses02M_script02_2_F017	 And when we were dancing you said the softest most intimate things to me right into my ears so I could feel them as much as hear them	Ses02M-script02-04-01-2_F017.wav	04
Ses05M_impro04_F029	 Have you checked out Craig's List and stuff?	Ses05M-impro04-01-01-F029.wav	01
Ses01F_impro06_M005	 Oh.  She was there?	Ses01F-impro06-01-01-M005.wav	01
Ses03F_impro08_M009	 What?  Are you kidding me?	Ses03F-impro08-05-01-M009.wav	05
Ses05F_impro04_F022	 That's really hard to hear.	Ses05F-impro04-04-01-F022.wav	04
Ses04M_script03_2_F024	 It's a pity you didn't- It's a pity you didn't have more brandy.	Ses04M-script03-01-01-2_F024.wav	01
Ses05M_impro01_F000	 Can I help you?	Ses05M-impro01-01-01-F000.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_3_M040	 And I felt wrong to be alive. To drive the car, to see the new checkbook, to see the new refrigerator. I mean, you can take those things out of the war. But you got to know that when you drive that car that that came out of the love a man can have for another man. And you got to be a little bit better because of that.	Ses03F-script01-04-01-3_M040.wav	04
Ses02M_impro03_F017	 Oh, my Gosh, that's so cute.	Ses02M-impro03-07-01-F017.wav	07
Ses01F_impro05_F022	 Who's in charge?  Who is the president of Jet Blue?	Ses01F-impro05-05-01-F022.wav	05
Ses03F_impro02_F040	 I know.	Ses03F-impro02-04-01-F040.wav	04
Ses05F_impro02_F002	 I'm sorry.  It's just a lot ahh to explain. ahh I got a call--	Ses05F-impro02-04-01-F002.wav	04
Ses04F_impro07_M051	 Are you going to take out loans or-	Ses04F-impro07-01-01-M051.wav	01
Ses04F_impro01_F016	 This is your job is to help people like me who need to get a new license.	Ses04F-impro01-05-01-F016.wav	05
Ses01F_script01_1_M040	 Then help me stay here.	Ses01F-script01-01-01-1_M040.wav	01
Ses01M_impro05_M026	 It'll be a lot more than what you're doing sitting here and just give me lip service.  I'd like to go back at least do some aggressive searching for my stuff.	Ses01M-impro05-05-01-M026.wav	05
Ses01F_script03_2_M026	 I think I mentioned once before that I've had three minute liquor glasses the whole evening long.  A child of two cannot get drunk on that.	Ses01F-script03-05-01-2_M026.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_1_M012	 You mustn't be serious, my dear.  That's just what they want.	Ses04M-script03-01-01-1_M012.wav	01
Ses01M_impro01_F024	 Uh huh.  I didn't come here get in yelling match either.	Ses01M-impro01-01-01-F024.wav	01
Ses04F_impro03_F004	 I know. I'm so-	Ses04F-impro03-07-01-F004.wav	07
Ses04F_script02_1_M032	 I've got good instincts for these things.  Look there. What's that.  Is that?  Is that, is that-no it's just seaweed isn't it.	Ses04F-script02-07-01-1_M032.wav	07
Ses01F_script02_1_M007	 The flashlight, the silver one.  There's only one, isn't there?	Ses01F-script02-01-01-1_M007.wav	01
Ses04F_impro07_M026	 You'd have to, like go somewhere else, and, you know, we would be apart, and that would suck.	Ses04F-impro07-01-01-M026.wav	01
Ses01F_script02_2_M016	 Okay.  So you were fine during that phone call from Marge and then dinner was okay.  And doing the dishes was fine and then I was going to take a shower and you're watching the news and you said the grunions are running tonight, do you want to go?  And I said, sure great, let's go.	Ses01F-script02-01-01-2_M016.wav	01
Ses03M_impro06_M006	 He was supposed to be the best man at my wedding.	Ses03M-impro06-04-01-M006.wav	04
Ses02F_impro06_F011	 I'm gonna forget him.	Ses02F-impro06-04-01-F011.wav	04
Ses01M_impro02_M015	 You're going to be fine.	Ses01M-impro02-04-01-M015.wav	04
Ses05F_script03_2_F018	 Um, It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.	Ses05F-script03-05-01-2_F018.wav	05
Ses04M_script02_1_M032	 They don't know what drives them.  They don't give it a name or ask a question.  They just turn, as one, and start the swim that brings them here; to this place, where we stand, for a massive celebration of sex and death.  Oh, man, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  All my hairs are popping up.	Ses04M-script02-07-01-1_M032.wav	07
Ses05F_impro02_M024	 I'll tell them I'm sick and that you can't leave something.	Ses05F-impro02-04-01-M024.wav	04
Ses02F_script01_3_M033	 I mean, you can take those things out of a war, but when you drive that car, you've gotta know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've gotta be a little better because of it.	Ses02F-script01-04-01-3_M033.wav	04
Ses05M_script01_2_F015	 You above all have got to believe.	Ses05M-script01-05-01-2_F015.wav	05
Ses01F_script03_2_M011	 No particular reason.  Anyhow, they are very small ones.	Ses01F-script03-01-01-2_M011.wav	01
Ses05M_impro02_F013	 Well, they're so young.	Ses05M-impro02-04-01-F013.wav	04
Ses04F_script03_2_M034	 There are people downstairs I suppose.	Ses04F-script03-05-01-2_M034.wav	05
Ses02M_impro05_M013	 But we have the tags on. I mean like it wouldn't you know, if it got stuck somewhere it's like well this is nobodies bag I mean maybe you know look on the tag and	Ses02M-impro05-05-01-M013.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_1_F025	 It went on intermittently for days.	Ses04M-script03-07-01-1_F025.wav	07
Ses05M_impro01_F004	 No, but this is for um- replacements and you need a new -- whole new license as a California --	Ses05M-impro01-01-01-F004.wav	01
Ses03F_impro02_F037	 Well, we- we tell her mommy's going on va- on a trip for for- a while.	Ses03F-impro02-04-01-F037.wav	04
Ses01M_script03_1_M029	 Come here darling, kiss me	Ses01M-script03-07-01-1_M029.wav	07
Ses05M_script01_3_F007	 Well, from her perspective, I mean, why else would I come here?	Ses05M-script01-01-01-3_F007.wav	01
Ses04M_impro03_M015	 Barefoot?	Ses04M-impro03-07-01-M015.wav	07
Ses03M_impro05b_M020	 You misplace a lot of, eight pieces of luggage.	Ses03M-impro05b-05-01-M020.wav	05
Ses01F_impro03_F022	 Fifty bucks. Mmhmm.	Ses01F-impro03-01-01-F022.wav	01

Ses02M_impro07_M008	 Yeah. I know, I know.	Ses02M-impro07-07-01-M008.wav	07
Ses01F_script01_3_M029	 Like for instance, there was this one time it had been raining for several days and this kid he just came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks.  He just put them in my pocket.  That's a little thing, you know, but that's what kind of guys I had.	Ses01F-script01-04-01-3_M029.wav	04
Ses03F_script03_2_M015	 Really, Amanda.	Ses03F-script03-05-01-2_M015.wav	05
Ses04F_impro07_F050	 while I'm in school.  It'll be good.	Ses04F-impro07-07-01-F050.wav	07
Ses01M_impro02_M013	 I guess you're just going to have to have it without me.	Ses01M-impro02-04-01-M013.wav	04
Ses04M_impro05_F013	 We'll cover fifty.	Ses04M-impro05-01-01-F013.wav	01
Ses01M_impro07_F013	 Oh, you don't like that. You're west-sider?	Ses01M-impro07-07-01-F013.wav	07
Ses03M_script01_1_M043	 Yes.  On this I would.	Ses03M-script01-01-01-1_M043.wav	01
Ses05F_impro02_M029	 I understand.  I'm worried about you.  I don't know what's going to happen to you.	Ses05F-impro02-04-01-M029.wav	04
Ses04M_script01_1_M031	 Alright, then, mom.  Did we skip something?  No.  Alright, then, mom.	Ses04M-script01-01-01-1_M031.wav	01
Ses02F_impro08_F019	 Okay, I can do um- a win- -two like a window and a aisle and a window and an aisle next to each other so that each of you can sit two by two. And switch around maybe?	Ses02F-impro08-01-01-F019.wav	01
Ses02F_script01_1_M037	 The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.	Ses02F-script01-05-01-1_M037.wav	05
Ses02M_script03_2_M047	 I wouldn't marry you again if you came to me on your bended knees. You're a evil minded little vampire. I hope to God I never see you again as long as I live.	Ses02M-script03-05-01-2_M047.wav	05
Ses02M_impro06_M009	 not being able to see anyone again, who knows where they really went, you know. I mean, I guess we can just hope that wherever they are now if it's anywhere that it's better I mean.	Ses02M-impro06-04-01-M009.wav	04
Ses05F_script03_1_M026	 Horrible thing, I hate it.	Ses05F-script03-07-01-1_M026.wav	07
Ses01M_script02_2_F010	 Why do you ask me that?  God damn it, I told you not to ask me that I hate it when you ask me that. It's insulting.	Ses01M-script02-05-01-2_F010.wav	05
Ses03F_impro02_F043	 I'm so sorry.	Ses03F-impro02-04-01-F043.wav	04
Ses04F_impro07_M028	 That's awesome.	Ses04F-impro07-07-01-M028.wav	07
Ses03M_impro03_F024	 You marry me. I man I Jane, you Tarzan.	Ses03M-impro03-07-01-F024.wav	07
Ses01M_impro06_F000	 You okay?	Ses01M-impro06-01-01-F000.wav	01

Ses04F_impro07_M017	 That's ridiculous.  I don't believe that.	Ses04F-impro07-01-01-M017.wav	01
Ses05M_impro07_M045	 I had to tell you right away.  I knew you'd be excited.	Ses05M-impro07-07-01-M045.wav	07
Ses04F_script03_2_M044	 Shut up.  Shut up. I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling to me on your bended knees.	Ses04F-script03-05-01-2_M044.wav	05
Ses05F_impro05_F004	 Right.	Ses05F-impro05-01-01-F004.wav	01
Ses05M_impro07_F015	 Yeah.  Totally- Well where are you going to live?	Ses05M-impro07-07-01-F015.wav	07
Ses05M_impro07_F020	 Yeah. I think it's really also if you- if you consider yourself like, us and them, kind of thing- If you think you're part of your community then --you going to like it more	Ses05M-impro07-01-01-F020.wav	01
Ses02F_impro04_M015	 That obviously that's not true though.  I mean, you've done this before.  You've done all the work like this before, you know, and and you've gotten people saying oh, you're so good and like you know--	Ses02F-impro04-01-01-M015.wav	01
Ses03F_script02_1_M039	 You know, they didn't ask it a question. They didn't, they didn't take a vote. They didn't have an invitation or a map; they just started swimming as one.	Ses03F-script02-07-01-1_M039.wav	07
Ses03F_impro05_F002	 Where? I don't know. The lost and found. What do you mean, lost and found?	Ses03F-impro05-05-01-F002.wav	05
Ses03F_script01_3_M003	 Well-	Ses03F-script01-01-01-3_M003.wav	01
Ses05M_script03_1_F012	 Who's they?	Ses05M-script03-01-01-1_F012.wav	01
Ses03M_impro02_M015	 You can do it.  Alright?  You can, you can be strong, you can be strong for both of us alright?	Ses03M-impro02-01-01-M015.wav	01
Ses03F_impro06_F024	 He was my brother.	Ses03F-impro06-04-01-F024.wav	04
Ses02F_impro08_F012	 Yes, I completely understand.  Actually, our-our airline only uses five star hotel and above.  Except we charge at a three star hotel rate because, as a corporation, we are able to get a deal from the hotels themselves.	Ses02F-impro08-01-01-F012.wav	01
Ses01M_script02_2_F033	 This isn't anything like I thought anything would be.	Ses01M-script02-04-01-2_F033.wav	04
Ses04M_script02_2_F029	 But this isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.	Ses04M-script02-05-01-2_F029.wav	05
Ses04M_impro03_M002	 Yeah, it's pretty amazing, huh?	Ses04M-impro03-07-01-M002.wav	07
Ses02M_impro05_F009	 Okay	Ses02M-impro05-01-01-F009.wav	01
Ses05F_impro08_F030	 I'm sorry that it was an inconvenience.	Ses05F-impro08-01-01-F030.wav	01
Ses01M_script03_2_M023	 You know what?  You snap, you snap, you snap you're like a little adder.	Ses01M-script03-05-01-2_M023.wav	05
Ses03M_script03_2_F010	 I don't know why you want it.  You've already had two glasses.	Ses03M-script03-05-01-2_F010.wav	05
Ses05F_script03_1_F011	 Meaning exactly that.	Ses05F-script03-01-01-1_F011.wav	01
Ses02M_impro02_F000	 I don't want you to go.	Ses02M-impro02-04-01-F000.wav	04
Ses05F_impro04_M007	 No, it doesn't pay the bills, but it would pay something.  And it would help you get somewhere else.	Ses05F-impro04-01-01-M007.wav	01

Ses03M_script03_1_F003	 Now and always sweet.	Ses03M-script03-07-01-1_F003.wav	07
Ses02F_impro05_F010	 Because you don't seem to care very much, you know.	Ses02F-impro05-05-01-F010.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_1_M029	 How -- that was a rouser wasn't it?	Ses04M-script03-07-01-1_M029.wav	07
Ses01M_script03_2_F027	 You always had a weak head.	Ses01M-script03-05-01-2_F027.wav	05
Ses03M_impro04_M031	 I was just joking...	Ses03M-impro04-04-01-M031.wav	04
Ses04F_impro07_F051	 Yeah.  It will work out.  Maybe I could work at Red Lobster.	Ses04F-impro07-07-01-F051.wav	07
Ses01F_script03_2_M001	 However I believe the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.	Ses01F-script03-01-01-2_M001.wav	01
Ses05M_impro08_M009	 Okay.  Is it being- Is it being compressed between anything by any chance?  Because sometimes your connection can be you know, disrupted by, you know, the cable being squished.	Ses05M-impro08-01-01-M009.wav	01
Ses01M_script01_1_F004	 Did you talk to him?	Ses01M-script01-04-01-1_F004.wav	04
Ses05F_impro06_F026	 It's hard to say good-bye.	Ses05F-impro06-04-01-F026.wav	04
Ses04F_impro03_M042	 has just rushed to my head, and I, and I mean honestly.	Ses04F-impro03-07-01-M042.wav	07

Ses01M_script02_2_F026	 No.	Ses01M-script02-04-01-2_F026.wav	04
Ses01M_impro07_F027	 I am not saying you should be. I'm not no. I think it's great I think you should be incredibly proud yourself especially because you're going to U.S.C for free for doing it. For free.	Ses01M-impro07-07-01-F027.wav	07
Ses02F_impro04_M008	 I know.  It makes it harder.  I mean it's definitely who you know in a lot of cases, but--	Ses02F-impro04-01-01-M008.wav	01
Ses01M_script02_2_F019	 Do you remember the first year we came here? It's about four years ago right after we got married.	Ses01M-script02-01-01-2_F019.wav	01
Ses04F_impro02_F009	 And now- and now it's really shitty timing but now I have to go.	Ses04F-impro02-04-01-F009.wav	04
Ses03M_script01_1_M017	 You know why I asked Annie here, right?	Ses03M-script01-01-01-1_M017.wav	01
Ses05F_impro07_F035	 We should go apartment shop-er-hunting.	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-F035.wav	07
Ses02F_script02_2_M029	 Well, welcome to the human race.  Do you think this is what I had in mind when I proposed?  That four years down the road, we'd be at the beach yelling at each other over fish?	Ses02F-script02-05-01-2_M029.wav	05
Ses02M_script03_1_M016	 No, that desire will fade along with our passion.	Ses02M-script03-04-01-1_M016.wav	04
Ses02M_impro07_M029	 I mean you got to - you got to show me the ropes 'cause I've never been there before so I mean you know your way around already and- [LAUGHTER]	Ses02M-impro07-07-01-M029.wav	07

Ses03F_script02_1_M009	 We should have brought our flashlight. I can't believe we forgot to bring it.	Ses03F-script02-07-01-1_M009.wav	07
Ses03F_script03_2_M002	 I remember it well. Bristling with diamonds. In the worst possible taste.	Ses03F-script03-05-01-2_M002.wav	05
Ses03F_impro02_M024	 It doesn't look very good.	Ses03F-impro02-04-01-M024.wav	04
Ses05M_script02_1_M001	 What's that? Is that- Wait, is that foam?  I can't even tell.  Oh Actually, I guess if I can't tell then it probably isn't it, is it?  It will probably be unmistakable, don't you think?	Ses05M-script02-07-01-1_M001.wav	07
Ses05M_impro02_F021	 [GARBAGE] You have to write me everyday.	Ses05M-impro02-04-01-F021.wav	04

Ses05M_script03_1_M013	 You mustn't be serious, darling.  That's just what they want.	Ses05M-script03-07-01-1_M013.wav	07
Ses04F_script02_1_M034	 Out there someplace there's this huge mass of silver fish heading this way.  They don't know why.  We don't know why.  It wasn't a decision.  They didn't take a vote.	Ses04F-script02-07-01-1_M034.wav	07
Ses03F_impro08_F013	 -on average would use.	Ses03F-impro08-01-01-F013.wav	01
Ses05F_impro06_M014	 Of course not.  You have no idea what it's like to lose a kid.	Ses05F-impro06-04-01-M014.wav	04
Ses02M_script01_2_M017	 Look at you -- look at you shaking.	Ses02M-script01-05-01-2_M017.wav	05

Ses02F_script02_1_M005	 Well, I guess we can tell, it probably isn't right?  Probably be unmistakable don't you think?	Ses02F-script02-07-01-1_M005.wav	07
Ses05M_impro06_M004	 You know, he was gonna, and we -- all the way up to the end we were just talking about how- you know all the stuff we were gonna do and, you know.  When he finally kicked this stupid cancer, you know, and we were gonna --	Ses05M-impro06-04-01-M004.wav	04
Ses05F_script03_2_F021	 I don't care if they bark and roll around like hoops, okay.	Ses05F-script03-05-01-2_F021.wav	05
Ses05M_script01_1_F000	 What's he going to say?  Maybe we should tell him before he sees it.	Ses05M-script01-04-01-1_F000.wav	04
Ses02M_script03_2_M042	 You're a vile tempered, loose living, wicked little beast and I hope I never see you again as long as I live.	Ses02M-script03-05-01-2_M042.wav	05
Ses03M_script03_2_F014	 What?	Ses03M-script03-05-01-2_F014.wav	05
Ses04M_script01_2_F011	 Nobody in this house dares take her faith away, Joe.  Strangers might, but not his father, not his brother.	Ses04M-script01-05-01-2_F011.wav	05
Ses03F_impro06_M012	 So nice, so positive.	Ses03F-impro06-04-01-M012.wav	04
Ses02M_script01_1_F032	 What the hell is this?	Ses02M-script01-05-01-1_F032.wav	05
Ses02M_script03_2_M000	 As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.	Ses02M-script03-01-01-2_M000.wav	01
Ses04M_script03_2_F010	 What of it?	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_F010.wav	05
Ses02F_impro08_F022	 So, it's a five hour flight, but you'll arrive only at eleven a clock in the morning.  So that day, you can have plenty of time to get to your hotel--Rest up and then still have a nice afternoon your first afternoon in Maui.	Ses02F-impro08-01-01-F022.wav	01
Ses01M_script03_1_F031	 Oh, Charles.  That was his name Charles. He did wriggle so beautifully.	Ses01M-script03-07-01-1_F031.wav	07

Ses05M_script03_1_M022	 So is everyone else in the long run.  Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as long as we can, like little quiet idiotic school children.	Ses05M-script03-07-01-1_M022.wav	07
Ses02M_impro03_F018	 Are your parents excited or...?	Ses02M-impro03-07-01-F018.wav	07

Ses02M_script01_3_M010	 I'm embarrassing you and I didn't want to tell it to you here.  I wanted some place we'd never been before.  A place where we'd be brand new to each other.	Ses02M-script01-07-01-3_M010.wav	07
Ses04F_impro07_M037	 I don't know I just thought that, you know, maybe we could, you know, I don't know.  It's like, you know, just test the waters anyway.  I don't see what the problem is.	Ses04F-impro07-07-01-M037.wav	07

Ses03F_impro02_F025	 It's going to be okay.	Ses03F-impro02-04-01-F025.wav	04
Ses01F_script02_2_M037	 Maybe if you were with someone else, too.	Ses01F-script02-04-01-2_M037.wav	04
