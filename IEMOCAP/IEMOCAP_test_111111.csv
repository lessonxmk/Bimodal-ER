Ses05F_impro07_M018	 We should try to find, like, a party spot though, like you know where there's going to be a lot of parties, where there are cool people, though.  Do you know any people that might be out there?	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-M018.wav	07
Ses05F_impro07_M021	 You can't make fun of me because I'm not going to school, though, because I'm going to be working though.	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-M021.wav	07

Ses03F_script01_1_M001	 He was out there when it happened.	Ses03F-script01-01-01-1_M001.wav	01
Ses01F_impro04_M006	 He's like a house manager. Yeah.  It's a good job.	Ses01F-impro04-01-01-M006.wav	01
Ses01F_impro04_M007	 You did?	Ses01F-impro04-01-01-M007.wav	01

Ses01F_impro04_M020	 Okay, yeah.  I would imagine.	Ses01F-impro04-01-01-M020.wav	01
Ses01F_impro04_M021	 Well, sometimes you have to do things that you don't necessarily like to do to have a job. But the job affords you money, you won't have to be taking the bus right now.	Ses01F-impro04-01-01-M021.wav	01

Ses05F_impro08_F030	 I'm sorry that it was an inconvenience.	Ses05F-impro08-01-01-F030.wav	01
Ses05F_impro08_F033	 bye bye	Ses05F-impro08-01-01-F033.wav	01
Ses05F_impro08_M020	 Are you taking the late fee off of my account then?	Ses05F-impro08-01-01-M020.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_2_M003	 How do you know he's even thinking about it?	Ses03F-script01-01-01-2_M003.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_2_M007	 How do you know why she's waited?	Ses03F-script01-01-01-2_M007.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_2_M009	 Calm yourself.	Ses03F-script01-01-01-2_M009.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_3_M003	 Well-	Ses03F-script01-01-01-3_M003.wav	01
Ses01F_impro05_M003	 Okay.	Ses01F-impro05-01-01-M003.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_3_M004	 What?	Ses03F-script01-01-01-3_M004.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_3_M026	 No, no, no, no. Nothing like that.	Ses03F-script01-01-01-3_M026.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_1_M026	 Every time I reach out for something I have to pull back because other people will suffer. My whole entire life, time and time after time.	Ses03F-script01-04-01-1_M026.wav	04
Ses05F_script01_1_F025	 Have you asked Annie yet to marry you?	Ses05F-script01-01-01-1_F025.wav	01
Ses05F_script01_1_M018	 I'm going to ask her to marry me.	Ses05F-script01-01-01-1_M018.wav	01
Ses05F_script01_2_M001	 Well maybe.  Maybe she just wanted to see her again.	Ses05F-script01-01-01-2_M001.wav	01
Ses01F_impro05_M011	 we've mistakenly lost your baggage.  We're very sorry.  On behalf of Jet Blue I would like to apologize for any inconvenience.  I am allowed to issue you a fifty dollar gift card which you can use any future flights you want to take with us.  I'm very sorry, once again...	Ses01F-impro05-01-01-M011.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_3_F025	 No. What is it? Is it your mother?	Ses03F-script01-04-01-3_F025.wav	04
Ses03F_script01_3_F029	 Yeah, sure.	Ses03F-script01-04-01-3_F029.wav	04
Ses01F_impro05_M017	 this is the only track record that we have and if it's not listed here then it's probably not anywhere.	Ses01F-impro05-01-01-M017.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_3_M031	 Just about all.	Ses03F-script01-04-01-3_M031.wav	04
Ses03F_script01_3_M032	 It takes a little while to toss that off. Because they weren't just men.	Ses03F-script01-04-01-3_M032.wav	04
Ses05F_script01_1_M004	 No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone.	Ses05F-script01-04-01-1_M004.wav	04
Ses05F_script01_1_M005	 I could hear him right through the floor of my room.	Ses05F-script01-04-01-1_M005.wav	04
Ses03F_script01_3_M035	 And I, and I thought something watching them go down.	Ses03F-script01-04-01-3_M035.wav	04
Ses03F_script01_3_M036	 Everything was being destroyed, see, but there was one new thing that was being created. A kind of responsibility, man for man. You understand me?	Ses03F-script01-04-01-3_M036.wav	04
Ses03F_script01_3_M038	 And I came back here and it was incredible. There was no meaning in that here. The whole thing to them was a bus accident.	Ses03F-script01-04-01-3_M038.wav	04
Ses01F_impro05_F011	 Is this a joke?	Ses01F-impro05-05-01-F011.wav	05
Ses03F_script01_1_F017	 It's those Goddamn newspapers, you know? I mean, it's like every day they come out with this new person that comes along. And the next one's going to be Larry.	Ses03F-script01-05-01-1_F017.wav	05
Ses01F_impro05_F018	 Do you understand who my husband is?	Ses01F-impro05-05-01-F018.wav	05
Ses01F_impro05_F019	 If you're- if you're- if you're looking for a lawsuit, baby, you've found it.	Ses01F-impro05-05-01-F019.wav	05
Ses01F_impro05_F020	 Oh-Oh.  It's a gift.  You're-You're helping me out here?	Ses01F-impro05-05-01-F020.wav	05
Ses03F_script01_2_F000	 Why did you invite her here?	Ses03F-script01-05-01-2_F000.wav	05
Ses03F_script01_2_F002	 You don't travel seven hundred miles just to see.	Ses03F-script01-05-01-2_F002.wav	05
Ses01F_impro05_F026	 What's your name?	Ses01F-impro05-05-01-F026.wav	05
Ses03F_script01_2_F004	 It's got that about it.	Ses03F-script01-05-01-2_F004.wav	05
Ses05F_script01_3_M034	 And then I went home and it was incredible.  It had no meaning here.	Ses05F-script01-04-01-3_M034.wav	04
Ses05F_script01_3_M036	 And I felt what you said- ashamed somehow-because nobody had changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a whole lot of guys. and	Ses05F-script01-04-01-3_M036.wav	04
Ses05F_script01_3_M037	 It felt wrong to be alive-to open that bank-book; to buy that new car; to look at that new refrigerator.  I mean, you can take those things out of the war, but if you drive that car, you have to know that that comes from the love that a man has for a man.  And you've got to be a little bit better than that!	Ses05F-script01-04-01-3_M037.wav	04
Ses05F_script01_1_F033	 What the hell is this?	Ses05F-script01-05-01-1_F033.wav	05
Ses05F_script01_1_F034	 Are you crazy?	Ses05F-script01-05-01-1_F034.wav	05
Ses03F_script01_2_M018	 Huh? What the hell's the matter with you, Kate?	Ses03F-script01-05-01-2_M018.wav	05
Ses05F_script01_1_M013	 For God's sake, mom, three years.  Nobody comes back after three years!  It's insane!	Ses05F-script01-05-01-1_M013.wav	05
Ses03F_script02_1_M019	 Right.	Ses03F-script02-01-01-1_M019.wav	01
Ses05F_script01_1_M035	 The business?  The business?  It doesn't inspire me?	Ses05F-script01-05-01-1_M035.wav	05
Ses05F_script01_2_M016	 What do you mean me above all?  Look at you.  You're shaking!	Ses05F-script01-05-01-2_M016.wav	05
Ses05F_script01_3_M016	 Oh God- I kissed Annie! I can't believe I kissed Annie!  How long I've wanted to do this.	Ses05F-script01-07-01-3_M016.wav	07
Ses01F_impro06_F005	 I went to see her headstone a week or two ago.	Ses01F-impro06-04-01-F005.wav	04
Ses01F_impro06_F006	 I used to go to cemeteries a lot before she died.  I just, you know, I felt like they were urban oasis, you know, there is always this green in the city.	Ses01F-impro06-04-01-F006.wav	04
Ses05F_script01_3_M039	 I I want you now, Annie.	Ses05F-script01-07-01-3_M039.wav	07
Ses05F_script02_1_F001	 What flashlight?	Ses05F-script02-01-01-1_F001.wav	01
Ses05F_script02_1_F007	 It's after eleven, let's go home.	Ses05F-script02-01-01-1_F007.wav	01
Ses01F_impro06_F011	 And I, you know, I mean, I said I was sorry and I brought it back to her kind of and I like put it on the ground and she was like, no, it's fine.  She was like, I would rather have her back, honestly.	Ses01F-impro06-04-01-F011.wav	04
Ses05F_script02_1_F011	 Not particularly.	Ses05F-script02-01-01-1_F011.wav	01
Ses05F_script02_1_F012	 I just don't.	Ses05F-script02-01-01-1_F012.wav	01
Ses05F_script02_2_M002	 It certainly is not. It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.	Ses05F-script02-01-01-2_M002.wav	01
Ses03F_script02_2_F039	 I know you are, Augie, and I know you wanted this evening to be nice, but I can't help thinking of being somewhere else.	Ses03F-script02-04-01-2_F039.wav	04
Ses01F_impro06_F024	 And the last time before she died, I remember she couldn't really stand, umm...	Ses01F-impro06-04-01-F024.wav	04
Ses03F_script02_2_F051	 I'm sorry, Augie.	Ses03F-script02-04-01-2_F051.wav	04
Ses05F_script02_2_F019	 No.	Ses05F-script02-04-01-2_F019.wav	04
Ses03F_script02_2_F031	 No.	Ses03F-script02-05-01-2_F031.wav	05
Ses05F_script02_2_F026	 Sure, this is standing.  This is waiting.  This is fighting.	Ses05F-script02-04-01-2_F026.wav	04
Ses03F_script02_2_M026	 A-a back rub, some ice cream, a suicide pact. What the hell do you want, Carla?	Ses03F-script02-05-01-2_M026.wav	05
Ses03F_script02_1_M001	 Look at the night we got; couldn't be better.	Ses03F-script02-07-01-1_M001.wav	07
Ses01F_impro07_F002	 I'm really excited.  Yeah. I don't know how I'm going to pay for anything, but... I also- Yeah.  Loans, too, yeah. I applied, though, for a bunch of grants and scholarships so I'm still waiting to hear on that.	Ses01F-impro07-07-01-F002.wav	07

Ses01F_impro07_F010	 Umm...P.h.D. [LAUGHTER]	Ses01F-impro07-07-01-F010.wav	07
Ses05F_script02_1_M000	 What time is it?  Isn't it supposed to start running around midnight?  This is great, isn't it?  Look at this great night we got here.  Couldn't be better--	Ses05F-script02-07-01-1_M000.wav	07
Ses05F_script02_1_M002	 Is that--no, no no is that foam?  I can't even tell, although if I- if I can't tell, it probably isn't it?  Right It'll probably be unmistakable, but don't you think?  How you doing?	Ses05F-script02-07-01-1_M002.wav	07
Ses05F_script02_1_M010	 I didn't even think to bring a six-pack.  A six-pack would be just the thing right about now. I can't believe I forgot.  And look at kid, I am surprise I make it out of the house about flies it.	Ses05F-script02-07-01-1_M010.wav	07

Ses03F_script02_1_M041	 They don't ask it a question. They just, they just, they don't know what drives them. They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them to here	Ses03F-script02-07-01-1_M041.wav	07
Ses01F_impro07_M014	 Teacher. Mrs. Nash, I have a question.	Ses01F-impro07-07-01-M014.wav	07

Ses03F_script03_2_M014	 You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want some yourself at the moment.	Ses03F-script03-05-01-2_M014.wav	05
Ses03F_script03_2_M015	 Really, Amanda.	Ses03F-script03-05-01-2_M015.wav	05

Ses01F_script01_3_M029	 Like for instance, there was this one time it had been raining for several days and this kid he just came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks.  He just put them in my pocket.  That's a little thing, you know, but that's what kind of guys I had.	Ses01F-script01-04-01-3_M029.wav	04
Ses01F_script01_3_M030	 They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that, exactly.  Just a little more selfish and they would all be here today.	Ses01F-script01-04-01-3_M030.wav	04
Ses03F_script03_1_M022	 Remember that awful scene we had in Venice?	Ses03F-script03-07-01-1_M022.wav	07

Ses03M_impro01_M029	 What is wrong with you?	Ses03M-impro01-05-01-M029.wav	05
Ses01F_script01_2_F010	 I want you to-- I want you to act like he is coming back, both of you.  Don't think I haven't noticed you since Chris invited her here.	Ses01F-script01-05-01-2_F010.wav	05
Ses03M_impro02_F013	 Do this whole thing by myself?	Ses03M-impro02-04-01-F013.wav	04
Ses03M_impro02_F015	 It's not the same thing.  It's not like having you here.	Ses03M-impro02-04-01-F015.wav	04
Ses05F_script03_1_M014	 Certainly you must.  We're figures of fun alright [LAUGHTER].	Ses05F-script03-07-01-1_M014.wav	07
Ses01F_script02_1_F015	 Not particularly.	Ses01F-script02-01-01-1_F015.wav	01
Ses05F_script03_1_M019	 No, no it isn't.  Death is very laughable.  Come such a cunning little mystery all done with mirrors.	Ses05F-script03-07-01-1_M019.wav	07

Ses03M_impro02_F030	 I'm done.  I can't honey.	Ses03M-impro02-04-01-F030.wav	04
Ses05F_script03_1_M025	 The one where you bought that little painted wooden snake and put it on my bed.	Ses05F-script03-07-01-1_M025.wav	07
Ses01F_script02_1_M020	 Right.	Ses01F-script02-01-01-1_M020.wav	01
Ses01F_script02_1_M021	 Wait, that's my point, too.	Ses01F-script02-01-01-1_M021.wav	01
Ses03M_impro02_M001	 Hey.	Ses03M-impro02-04-01-M001.wav	04

Ses03M_impro02_M028	 Well that's the kind of work I'm in honey.	Ses03M-impro02-04-01-M028.wav	04
Ses03M_impro02_M029	 It's just going to be--it's going to go faster than you think.	Ses03M-impro02-04-01-M029.wav	04
Ses01F_script02_2_F047	 Or not.	Ses01F-script02-01-01-2_F047.wav	01
Ses03M_impro03_F018	 Isn't it a rat?  It's a rat.  Chuck E. Cheese?	Ses03M-impro03-01-01-F018.wav	01
Ses03M_impro03_F036	 You still act like a boy.  And men take a lot longer to grow----I will tell you.	Ses03M-impro03-01-01-F036.wav	01
Ses01F_script02_2_M019	 It's when we were driving past that Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, let's get some champagne.  I said no, time's a wasting or something like that.	Ses01F-script02-01-01-2_M019.wav	01
Ses01F_script02_2_M021	 Sure.  All right.  Okay.	Ses01F-script02-01-01-2_M021.wav	01
Ses01F_script02_2_M022	 Listen, do you want to dance?	Ses01F-script02-01-01-2_M022.wav	01
Ses05M_impro02_M001	 I know it's really crappy timing, but I don't have a choice.	Ses05M-impro02-04-01-M001.wav	04
Ses05M_impro02_M007	 I don't have a choice.  I have to go.  If I don't go, they'll come and take me.	Ses05M-impro02-04-01-M007.wav	04

Ses05M_impro02_M023	 I know.  I know.  I know.  But, you know what?  That doesn't mean it's gonna be me; does it?	Ses05M-impro02-04-01-M023.wav	04
Ses01F_script02_2_F022	 I'd rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for some things.	Ses01F-script02-04-01-2_F022.wav	04
Ses03M_impro03_M002	 [LAUGHTER] Guess who just got hitched?	Ses03M-impro03-07-01-M002.wav	07

Ses05M_impro03_F026	 Are you going to start right away?	Ses05M-impro03-01-01-F026.wav	01
Ses01F_script02_2_F006	 Don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that, you always ask me that.  It's insulting.	Ses01F-script02-05-01-2_F006.wav	05
Ses05M_impro03_F030	 Oooh	Ses05M-impro03-01-01-F030.wav	01

Ses01F_script03_2_F032	 They are away in Tunis.	Ses01F-script03-01-01-2_F032.wav	01
Ses03M_impro04_M004	 Cause I went to Harvard.	Ses03M-impro04-05-01-M004.wav	05
Ses01F_script03_2_M031	 This is no time of year for Tunis.	Ses01F-script03-01-01-2_M031.wav	01
Ses01F_script03_2_F015	 No.  I am just making myself fascinating for you.	Ses01F-script03-05-01-2_F015.wav	05
Ses01F_script03_2_F016	 Oh.  It's a woman's duty to allure the man.	Ses01F-script03-05-01-2_F016.wav	05
Ses01F_script03_2_F018	 You shut up.	Ses01F-script03-05-01-2_F018.wav	05

Ses05M_impro04_F015	 I don't know.  I'm I'm just trying --	Ses05M-impro04-01-01-F015.wav	01
Ses01F_script03_2_F024	 You're quite insufferable, I expect it's because you are drunk.	Ses01F-script03-05-01-2_F024.wav	05
Ses01F_script03_2_F025	 You've always had a weak head.	Ses01F-script03-05-01-2_F025.wav	05
Ses05M_impro04_F020	 Yeah, it's stressful.  I recognize that.	Ses05M-impro04-01-01-F020.wav	01
Ses03M_impro05a_M002	 I had eight hundred pounds of luggage.	Ses03M-impro05a-05-01-M002.wav	05
Ses03M_impro05a_M006	 You don't know where we're at?	Ses03M-impro05a-05-01-M006.wav	05
Ses05M_impro04_F030	 What if you do kids parties? oh, come on.	Ses05M-impro04-01-01-F030.wav	01
Ses03M_impro05a_M012	 And what are you going to do about it?  You going to call someone?  You going to send me somewhere else?	Ses03M-impro05a-05-01-M012.wav	05
Ses05M_impro04_F031	 Okay.  All right.	Ses05M-impro04-01-01-F031.wav	01

Ses05M_impro04_F034	 That's rough.  I'm really sorry, Ryan.	Ses05M-impro04-01-01-F034.wav	01
Ses03M_impro05a_M017	 Sherlock Holmes.  God, where's my luggage?	Ses03M-impro05a-05-01-M017.wav	05

Ses01F_script03_2_M023	 Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?	Ses01F-script03-05-01-2_M023.wav	05
Ses01F_script03_2_M024	 And I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more than, too. Yes.  I suppose you guys had a riotous time, huh?  All out, no restraint at all.  Well, you never really had much anyhow.	Ses01F-script03-05-01-2_M024.wav	05
Ses01F_script03_2_M025	 I think I am not in the least bit drunk.	Ses01F-script03-05-01-2_M025.wav	05
Ses01F_script03_2_M026	 I think I mentioned once before that I've had three minute liquor glasses the whole evening long.  A child of two cannot get drunk on that.	Ses01F-script03-05-01-2_M026.wav	05
Ses03M_impro05a_M024	 What?  Are you kidding me?	Ses03M-impro05a-05-01-M024.wav	05
Ses05M_impro04_M019	 An abrasive vibe?	Ses05M-impro04-05-01-M019.wav	05
Ses01F_script03_2_M030	 Well then you'll wake up the people downstairs.	Ses01F-script03-05-01-2_M030.wav	05
Ses03M_impro05b_F001	 Okay.  Well let's...well I'm going to go ahead and check on that for you.  You're coming from...where are you coming from?	Ses03M-impro05b-01-01-F001.wav	01
Ses01F_script03_2_M040	 Shut up. Shut up. God, I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling back to me on a bended knee.  You are a vile, ill-tempered, mean little wench and I never want to see you again as long as I live.	Ses01F-script03-05-01-2_M040.wav	05
Ses03M_impro05b_F006	 Yes.	Ses03M-impro05b-01-01-F006.wav	01
Ses03M_impro05b_F007	 Well sir, if if...what I believe has happened is most of the flight was left--	Ses03M-impro05b-01-01-F007.wav	01
Ses01F_script03_1_F024	 Oh Charles, that was his name.  He did wiggle so beautifully.	Ses01F-script03-07-01-1_F024.wav	07
Ses01F_script03_1_M005	 I don't care then.	Ses01F-script03-07-01-1_M005.wav	07
Ses03M_impro05b_F008	 the luggage was left in Baltimore.  Therefore--	Ses03M-impro05b-01-01-F008.wav	01
Ses05M_impro05_F010	 No, you have to buy it now.  It's like thirty dollar extra.	Ses05M-impro05-01-01-F010.wav	01
Ses03M_impro05b_F013	 We can do Holiday Inn or...?	Ses03M-impro05b-01-01-F013.wav	01
Ses01M_impro01_M003	 Yes, Jones.	Ses01M-impro01-01-01-M003.wav	01
Ses01M_impro01_M010	 No, I don't have a passport.	Ses01M-impro01-01-01-M010.wav	01
Ses03M_impro05b_F014	 Sir I understand that but just--	Ses03M-impro05b-01-01-F014.wav	01
Ses01M_impro01_F001	 My window is open.	Ses01M-impro01-05-01-F001.wav	05
Ses03M_impro05b_F016	 Okay.  So if you can just give me your name, your name and your address and your phone number I can contact you as soon as we find out more information.	Ses03M-impro05b-01-01-F016.wav	01
Ses05M_impro05_F019	 -- it's a biohazard. so- um	Ses05M-impro05-01-01-F019.wav	01
Ses03M_impro05b_F021	 Well, the entire flight, sir, the luggage was placed on another plane that never actually left Baltimore.	Ses03M-impro05b-01-01-F021.wav	01
Ses01M_impro01_F012	 Probably.	Ses01M-impro01-05-01-F012.wav	05
Ses05M_impro05_M005	 Yeah, I know I was in the country.  I mean, it's not that complicated.	Ses05M-impro05-01-01-M005.wav	01
Ses01M_impro01_F021	 Do you know how long I've been working here? How long have you lived in California?	Ses01M-impro01-05-01-F021.wav	05
Ses01M_impro01_F022	 Maybe you never been to the D.M.V. before, maybe you should get back in line.  You know what?  sit in line again and if you get my number ask for different one.	Ses01M-impro01-05-01-F022.wav	05
Ses03M_impro05b_F029	 Uh--	Ses03M-impro05b-01-01-F029.wav	01
Ses05M_impro06_F002	 Oh, I'm so sorry	Ses05M-impro06-04-01-F002.wav	04
Ses03M_impro05b_M014	 Okay, so you can put me in Holiday Inn for twenty dollar a night?	Ses03M-impro05b-05-01-M014.wav	05
Ses01M_impro02_F009	 I don't even know what to tell you.	Ses01M-impro02-04-01-F009.wav	04
Ses05M_impro06_F009	 Yeah. I understand.  I think it's really healthy to grieve.	Ses05M-impro06-04-01-F009.wav	04
Ses01M_impro02_F017	 Mm hmm.  We'll build a bunker and never come out.	Ses01M-impro02-04-01-F017.wav	04
Ses03M_impro05b_M025	 This is the worst customer service I've ever gotten before.	Ses03M-impro05b-05-01-M025.wav	05

Ses01M_script01_3_F012	 I almost got married two years ago.	Ses01M-script01-01-01-3_F012.wav	01

Ses03M_script02_2_M030	 I was just like you.  I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and everything great and the sand in our toes and the wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'd have three big fat rosy kids...	Ses03M-script02-05-01-2_M030.wav	05
Ses01M_script01_1_M040	 Then help me stay.	Ses01M-script01-04-01-1_M040.wav	04
Ses05M_script02_1_M017	 Honey, it's a natural phenomenon.  I mean, this kind of thing only happens once a year.  It's a great opportunity.	Ses05M-script02-07-01-1_M017.wav	07
Ses05M_script02_1_M020	 and all that about flopping around, it's like laying eggs or what do you -- spawning or mating or something like that.	Ses05M-script02-07-01-1_M020.wav	07
Ses01M_script01_3_F018	 Chris, what's the matter?	Ses01M-script01-04-01-3_F018.wav	04
Ses03M_script02_1_M002	 You know actually I wanted to go a little further up the coast and get away from all the lights and people but I was afraid you'd miss it.  How are you doing?	Ses03M-script02-07-01-1_M002.wav	07
Ses05M_script02_1_M028	 Look there.  What is that?  Is that -- Oh No, that's seaweed.	Ses05M-script02-07-01-1_M028.wav	07

Ses01M_script01_3_F025	 [BREATHING]. Geez.	Ses01M-script01-04-01-3_F025.wav	04
Ses03M_script02_1_M023	 Honey, this is a natural phenomenon.  It only happens once a year.  I mean think about the people in Kansas, they would have to get hotel reservations and plane tickets to come and see this.  We're only forty minutes away.  This is too good to pass up.	Ses03M-script02-07-01-1_M023.wav	07
Ses05M_script02_2_M001	 What I was just saying.	Ses05M-script02-07-01-2_M001.wav	07
Ses01M_script01_3_M020	 Do you want to go somewhere?  Let's go.	Ses01M-script01-04-01-3_M020.wav	04
Ses05M_script03_1_F012	 Who's they?	Ses05M-script03-01-01-1_F012.wav	01

Ses05M_script03_1_F031	 You knew there was nothing in that.	Ses05M-script03-01-01-1_F031.wav	01
Ses03M_script02_1_M040	 They just start swimming to this place right here where we stand for massive celebration of sex and death.	Ses03M-script02-07-01-1_M040.wav	07
Ses05M_script03_2_F006	 Well it gave him a lot of pleasure and it didn't hurt me.	Ses05M-script03-01-01-2_F006.wav	01
Ses05M_script03_2_F009	 No thanks.	Ses05M-script03-01-01-2_F009.wav	01
Ses01M_script01_3_M034	 I thought I would change everything you know, and I got back here and it was- it was like nothing had changed at all...	Ses01M-script01-04-01-3_M034.wav	04
Ses03M_script03_1_M035	 I didn't hit you very hard.	Ses03M-script03-01-01-1_M035.wav	01
Ses01M_script01_3_M038	 'Cause you can take those things out of a war.  But you have to realize that those things came out of the love that a man can have for another man...	Ses01M-script01-04-01-3_M038.wav	04
Ses03M_script03_2_F012	 It's become a habit with you.	Ses03M-script03-01-01-2_F012.wav	01
Ses01M_script01_3_M040	 I felt ashamed and I didn't want any part of it.  I guess I included you too.	Ses01M-script01-04-01-3_M040.wav	04
Ses03M_script03_2_F017	 That's the woman's job to lure the man.  Watch me a moment won't you?	Ses03M-script03-01-01-2_F017.wav	01
Ses05M_script03_2_F017	 No, it isn't.	Ses05M-script03-05-01-2_F017.wav	05

Ses05M_script03_2_F038	 Stop.  Would you just go away?  I mean, you're conceited, and overbearing, and utterly impossible.	Ses05M-script03-05-01-2_F038.wav	05
Ses01M_script01_1_F029	 I don't see why it has to be Annie.	Ses01M-script01-05-01-1_F029.wav	05
Ses03M_script03_2_F011	 I don't see what you have to go on and on with this kind of thing.	Ses03M-script03-05-01-2_F011.wav	05

Ses03M_script03_2_F038	 Very well.  If you insist on being a boorish and idiotic.	Ses03M-script03-05-01-2_F038.wav	05
Ses01M_script01_1_M021	 She is not Larry's girl.	Ses01M-script01-05-01-1_M021.wav	05
Ses01M_script01_1_M034	 Business?  The business doesn't inspire me.	Ses01M-script01-05-01-1_M034.wav	05
Ses01M_script01_2_F004	 What is going on here, Joe?	Ses01M-script01-05-01-2_F004.wav	05
Ses01M_script01_2_F005	 The girl is not Larry's.  If the girl is Larry's girl she's not his she know she's not.	Ses01M-script01-05-01-2_F005.wav	05
Ses05M_script03_2_M035	 This is no time of the year for Tunis.	Ses05M-script03-05-01-2_M035.wav	05
Ses01M_script01_2_F011	 Oh, laugh at me, laugh all you like but why does this happen to very night she comes back?  She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look at it, Joe look.	Ses01M-script01-05-01-2_F011.wav	05
Ses05M_script03_2_M040	 Ja! Very funny.	Ses05M-script03-05-01-2_M040.wav	05

Ses01M_script01_3_M018	 I kissed you.  I kissed Annie.	Ses01M-script01-07-01-3_M018.wav	07
Ses03M_script03_2_M032	 We might be able to bring up a splendid little debate about this intemperate tots.	Ses03M-script03-05-01-2_M032.wav	05
Ses01M_script02_1_M007	 Flashlight the silver one.  There's only one isn't there?	Ses01M-script02-01-01-1_M007.wav	01
Ses05M_script03_1_F005	 Oh, it sent shivers up my spine.	Ses05M-script03-07-01-1_F005.wav	07
Ses05M_script03_1_F026	 Oh, It burnt my comb and all the towels in the bathroom.	Ses05M-script03-07-01-1_F026.wav	07
Ses05M_script03_1_M006	 Oh, what shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us.	Ses05M-script03-07-01-1_M006.wav	07
Ses03M_script03_2_M044	 Just shut up.	Ses03M-script03-05-01-2_M044.wav	05
Ses03M_script03_1_F003	 Now and always sweet.	Ses03M-script03-07-01-1_F003.wav	07
Ses01M_script02_2_F019	 Do you remember the first year we came here? It's about four years ago right after we got married.	Ses01M-script02-01-01-2_F019.wav	01
Ses05M_script03_1_M010	 Uhh, You mustn't say that, my darling.	Ses05M-script03-07-01-1_M010.wav	07

Ses04F_impro01_F004	 I did exactly what they told me to do.	Ses04F-impro01-05-01-F004.wav	05
Ses04F_impro01_F008	 I've been to the back of the line five times.	Ses04F-impro01-05-01-F008.wav	05

Ses01M_script02_2_M025	 Oh right sure, of course.	Ses01M-script02-01-01-2_M025.wav	01
Ses05M_script03_1_M022	 So is everyone else in the long run.  Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as long as we can, like little quiet idiotic school children.	Ses05M-script03-07-01-1_M022.wav	07
Ses05M_script03_1_M023	 [garbage] Darling, kiss me before your body rots and worms start popping in and out of your eye sockets.	Ses05M-script03-07-01-1_M023.wav	07

Ses01M_script02_2_M030	 You want to get married again?	Ses01M-script02-01-01-2_M030.wav	01
Ses05M_script03_1_M024	 I don't care what you do.  See, you could paint your body bright green and and run naked through the Place Vendome and run with every man in the world and I shan't say a word.  As long as I know that you love me best.	Ses05M-script03-07-01-1_M024.wav	07
Ses05M_script03_1_M026	 The one where you bought that little painted wooden stake and you put it on my bed.	Ses05M-script03-07-01-1_M026.wav	07

Ses01M_script02_2_F040	 You are the one who probably wishes he was with somebody else, someone who didn't take everything so seriously, someone who would enjoy yourself.	Ses01M-script02-04-01-2_F040.wav	04
Ses04F_impro02_F007	 I have to do this.  I don't want to leave.  Do you think I want to miss seeing her grow up?	Ses04F-impro02-04-01-F007.wav	04
Ses04F_impro02_F009	 And now- and now it's really shitty timing but now I have to go.	Ses04F-impro02-04-01-F009.wav	04
Ses04F_impro02_M001	 This is really-this is unfair.	Ses04F-impro02-04-01-M001.wav	04

Ses01M_script02_2_M033	 A new carpet, a poodle, a suicide pact, ice cream, a back rub, what?  What?  What the hell do you want?	Ses01M-script02-05-01-2_M033.wav	05
Ses01M_script02_1_M001	 Of course I did want to a little further up the coast you know get away from all the lights and people and everything.  Is it midnight, do they always start at midnight?

Ses04F_impro03_M034	 Fried chicken, mashed potatoes.	Ses04F-impro03-01-01-M034.wav	01
Ses04F_impro03_M047	 I don't know.  Okay.  I mean gosh.  There's just- look there's a lot of pressure in getting married, okay.	Ses04F-impro03-01-01-M047.wav	01
Ses01M_script02_1_M043	 Like some little time release fire cracker went off inside their little tiny bodies.  And they all turned as one...	Ses01M-script02-07-01-1_M043.wav	07
Ses04F_impro03_F007	 Well actually we were just talking about today and I don't really want to do like the traditional church thing, you know.  So we are going to get married in the meadow.	Ses04F-impro03-07-01-F007.wav	07
Ses04F_impro03_F009	 We're going to get married in the middle of a meadow. [LAUGHTER]	Ses04F-impro03-07-01-F009.wav	07

Ses04F_impro03_F014	 Okey Well- well-, you know what?  I was hoping that you would help	Ses04F-impro03-07-01-F014.wav	07
Ses04F_impro03_F034	 Throw in a little- little, uh, trim in yellow.  Maybe some yellow flowers.	Ses04F-impro03-07-01-F034.wav	07
Ses01M_script03_2_F022	 They sting.	Ses01M-script03-05-01-2_F022.wav	05
Ses01M_script03_2_F024	 Yes, I did quite a lot.	Ses01M-script03-05-01-2_F024.wav	05
Ses04F_impro03_F044	 You don't look like you're going to faint.	Ses04F-impro03-07-01-F044.wav	07

Ses04F_impro08_F005	 Okay.  Um, and what was the complaint?	Ses04F-impro08-01-01-F005.wav	01
Ses04F_impro08_M012	 It was a hundred a sixty dollars.  I'm sorry, uh, sixteen dollars.	Ses04F-impro08-01-01-M012.wav	01
Ses04F_impro08_F023	 But I'm giving you what you want.	Ses04F-impro08-05-01-F023.wav	05
Ses02F_impro07_M003	 Are you gonna go? you gonna-	Ses02F-impro07-07-01-M003.wav	07
Ses04F_impro08_M015	 and if I get sent to another operator, I'll have to tell them the same damn story again.  I don't- I think I'm just going to lose my mind.  So if you could please just not do that, that would be great.  Thank you.	Ses04F-impro08-05-01-M015.wav	05
Ses02F_impro07_M007	 Yeah.	Ses02F-impro07-07-01-M007.wav	07
Ses04F_impro08_M019	 because I know you're at a desk right now in your stupid corporate building and you're going to send me a check for sixteen dollars and forty two cents.	Ses04F-impro08-05-01-M019.wav	05
Ses04F_impro08_M024	 attached to it and you don't send it to me, I'm going to get very upset.	Ses04F-impro08-05-01-M024.wav	05
Ses04F_script01_1_M017	 I'm going to ask her to marry me.	Ses04F-script01-01-01-1_M017.wav	01
Ses04F_script01_2_M001	 Well maybe- maybe he just wanted to see her again.	Ses04F-script01-01-01-2_M001.wav	01
Ses02F_impro08_F004	 Oh, yeah, absolutely.  You know, and especially because you've been waiting so long and I know that, um, you've been having a difficult time.	Ses02F-impro08-01-01-F004.wav	01
Ses04F_script01_3_M008	 I guess you know this is why I asked you to come.	Ses04F-script01-01-01-3_M008.wav	01
Ses04F_script01_1_M004	 No, I figured the best thing was to leave him alone.	Ses04F-script01-04-01-1_M004.wav	04
Ses04F_script01_1_M005	 I could hear him right through the floor of my room.	Ses04F-script01-04-01-1_M005.wav	04
Ses02F_impro08_F010	 um, you're scheduling a flight as well--And you would like to, um, we have a highly discounted hotel rate that goes along with that so that everything is all in one deal.  You're taken care of by the time that you get there.	Ses02F-impro08-01-01-F010.wav	01
Ses02F_impro08_F011	 Absolutely. we we	Ses02F-impro08-01-01-F011.wav	01
Ses02F_impro08_F012	 Yes, I completely understand.  Actually, our-our airline only uses five star hotel and above.  Except we charge at a three star hotel rate because, as a corporation, we are able to get a deal from the hotels themselves.	Ses02F-impro08-01-01-F012.wav	01
Ses04F_script01_1_M032	 These years when I think of someone for my wife, I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram?	Ses04F-script01-04-01-1_M032.wav	04
Ses02F_impro08_F017	 Okay.  Great.  Four seats.  I'll book you for four seats.	Ses02F-impro08-01-01-F017.wav	01
Ses04F_script01_3_M028	 Well I lost them.	Ses04F-script01-04-01-3_M028.wav	04
Ses02F_impro08_F019	 Okay, I can do um- a win- -two like a window and a aisle and a window and an aisle next to each other so that each of you can sit two by two. And switch around maybe?	Ses02F-impro08-01-01-F019.wav	01
Ses04F_script01_3_M029	 Just about all.	Ses04F-script01-04-01-3_M029.wav	04
Ses02F_impro08_F022	 So, it's a five hour flight, but you'll arrive only at eleven a clock in the morning.  So that day, you can have plenty of time to get to your hotel--Rest up and then still have a nice afternoon your first afternoon in Maui.	Ses02F-impro08-01-01-F022.wav	01
Ses02F_impro08_F023	 Absolutely.  That actually goes in on the same package with our hotel.  You just give me your address.  We'll come and pick up a time that allows you to get to your flight with plenty of time to spare.	Ses02F-impro08-01-01-F023.wav	01
Ses04F_script01_3_M033	 They didn't die.  They killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today.	Ses04F-script01-04-01-3_M033.wav	04
Ses04F_script01_3_M040	 because nobody was changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.	Ses04F-script01-04-01-3_M040.wav	04
Ses04F_script01_3_M044	 Otherwise what you have is really just loot and there's blood on it.  I didn't want to take any of it.	Ses04F-script01-04-01-3_M044.wav	04
Ses04F_script01_3_M045	 I guess that included you.	Ses04F-script01-04-01-3_M045.wav	04
Ses02F_impro08_M008	 Okay. So--	Ses02F-impro08-01-01-M008.wav	01
Ses04F_script01_1_F014	 To you it is and to me but not to him.  You can talk yourself blue in the face but there's no body and no grave so where are you?	Ses04F-script01-05-01-1_F014.wav	05
Ses02F_impro08_M015	 Uh, well, yeah, I think we were just--you know, whenever best available, I guess.  You know--	Ses02F-impro08-01-01-M015.wav	01
Ses02F_impro08_M016	 And, like, there's there's shuttles or something that I can get to the hotel.	Ses02F-impro08-01-01-M016.wav	01
Ses02F_impro08_M018	 All right.  So we're confirmed then or do you--All right.	Ses02F-impro08-01-01-M018.wav	01
Ses04F_script01_1_F022	 I ignore what I got to ignore. The girl is Larry's girl.	Ses04F-script01-05-01-1_F022.wav	05
Ses04F_script01_1_F029	 I don't see why it has to be Annie.	Ses04F-script01-05-01-1_F029.wav	05
Ses02F_script01_1_F021	 I'm just saying that--	Ses02F-script01-01-01-1_F021.wav	01
Ses02F_script01_1_F027	 Well, how do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way your father does.	Ses02F-script01-01-01-1_F027.wav	01
Ses04F_script01_1_F041	 because what the hell did we work for?  This whole shooting match is just for you, Chris.	Ses04F-script01-05-01-1_F041.wav	05
Ses02F_script01_1_M040	 Yes, on this I would.	Ses02F-script01-01-01-1_M040.wav	01
Ses04F_script01_1_M009	 You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?	Ses04F-script01-05-01-1_M009.wav	05
Ses04F_script01_1_M012	 We've got to say it to him.	Ses04F-script01-05-01-1_M012.wav	05
Ses04F_script01_1_M013	 For God's sake three years.  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane.	Ses04F-script01-05-01-1_M013.wav	05
Ses04F_script01_1_M020	 Then it isn't just my business.	Ses04F-script01-05-01-1_M020.wav	05
Ses02F_script01_2_M008	 How do you know why she's waited?	Ses02F-script01-01-01-2_M008.wav	01
Ses04F_script01_1_M025	 To hell with that.	Ses04F-script01-05-01-1_M025.wav	05
Ses04F_script01_1_M028	 and then we'll thrash it out with dad, right mom.  Don't avoid me.	Ses04F-script01-05-01-1_M028.wav	05
Ses04F_script01_1_M030	 Because it is.	Ses04F-script01-05-01-1_M030.wav	05
Ses02F_script01_1_F006	 What was he doing out here at that hour?	Ses02F-script01-04-01-1_F006.wav	04
Ses02F_script01_1_M027	 Well, if she does, then that's the end of it.  But from her letters, I think she's forgotten him.  I'll find out.  And then we'll thrash it out with Dad, right?  Mom, don't avoid me.	Ses02F-script01-04-01-1_M027.wav	04
Ses04F_script01_2_F006	 No, line.	Ses04F-script01-05-01-2_F006.wav	05
Ses02F_script01_3_F020	 Then, what's wrong?  I mean, even in your letters there was some--something ashamed.	Ses02F-script01-04-01-3_F020.wav	04
Ses02F_script01_3_F021	 You've gotta tell me.	Ses02F-script01-04-01-3_F021.wav	04
Ses04F_script01_2_F016	 She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look, look at it.  Joe-	Ses04F-script01-05-01-2_F016.wav	05
Ses02F_script01_3_M020	 No.  Nothing like that.	Ses02F-script01-04-01-3_M020.wav	04
Ses04F_script02_1_M017	 That's my point too.	Ses04F-script02-01-01-1_M017.wav	01
Ses04F_script02_2_M020	 It was in the car right.  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said let's get some champagne and I said times a wasting or something like that.  Right?	Ses04F-script02-01-01-2_M020.wav	01
Ses02F_script01_3_M030	 You know what I mean?  To show that, to bring that onto the Earth again, like some kind of monument and everyone would feel it standing behind him and it would make a difference to him.	Ses02F-script01-04-01-3_M030.wav	04
Ses02F_script01_3_M033	 I mean, you can take those things out of a war, but when you drive that car, you've gotta know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've gotta be a little better because of it.	Ses02F-script01-04-01-3_M033.wav	04
Ses02F_script01_3_M034	 Because otherwise all you have is really loot and there's blood on it.  And I didn't want to take any of it.  And I guess that included you.	Ses02F-script01-04-01-3_M034.wav	04
Ses04F_script02_2_F020	 and you popped the cork and while we were dancing, you said the softest most intimate things to me	Ses04F-script02-04-01-2_F020.wav	04
Ses02F_script01_1_F037	 What about the business?  What the hell is this?	Ses02F-script01-05-01-1_F037.wav	05
Ses02F_script01_1_F038	 Must you be inspired?	Ses02F-script01-05-01-1_F038.wav	05
Ses04F_script02_1_F013	 Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach, flop around, and then swim away and then they die.	Ses04F-script02-05-01-1_F013.wav	05
Ses04F_script02_1_F019	 We didn't see them the first time either.	Ses04F-script02-05-01-1_F019.wav	05
Ses04F_script02_1_F021	 About what?	Ses04F-script02-05-01-1_F021.wav	05

Ses02F_script02_2_M001	 What I was saying.	Ses02F-script02-01-01-2_M001.wav	01
Ses02F_script02_2_M002	 It certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.	Ses02F-script02-01-01-2_M002.wav	01
Ses04F_script02_1_M034	 Out there someplace there's this huge mass of silver fish heading this way.  They don't know why.  We don't know why.  It wasn't a decision.  They didn't take a vote.	Ses04F-script02-07-01-1_M034.wav	07
Ses02F_script02_2_M010	 Well, we'll see them this year.	Ses02F-script02-01-01-2_M010.wav	01

Ses02F_script02_1_M015	 I can't believe I forgot.  I'm like a kid.  It's amazing I got out of the house with my fly zipped.	Ses02F-script02-07-01-1_M015.wav	07
Ses02F_script02_1_M025	 Yeah, but that moment on the beach, is the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping is laying eggs or what do you--spawning or mating.  I mean,	Ses02F-script02-07-01-1_M025.wav	07
Ses02F_script02_1_M035	 There is that--no that's just seaweed isn't it?	Ses02F-script02-07-01-1_M035.wav	07
Ses02F_script02_1_M036	 Oh man, this is great, isn't it?  I wouldn't miss this for anything.  Here, think about this, all right, I know you're not interested, but think about this.	Ses02F-script02-07-01-1_M036.wav	07
Ses02F_script02_1_M039	 all as one, this time release instinctual little firecracker went off and they all turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming.  And they're swimming right now as if that's all that matters.	Ses02F-script02-07-01-1_M039.wav	07
Ses04F_script03_2_M015	 Nothing.	Ses04F-script03-05-01-2_M015.wav	05
Ses04F_script03_2_M027	 I'm not in the least drunk.	Ses04F-script03-05-01-2_M027.wav	05
Ses04F_script03_2_M035	 This is no time of year for Tunis.	Ses04F-script03-05-01-2_M035.wav	05
Ses02F_script03_1_F013	 If I laugh at everything, then I must laugh at us too.	Ses02F-script03-01-01-1_F013.wav	01
Ses04F_script03_2_M044	 Shut up.  Shut up. I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling to me on your bended knees.	Ses04F-script03-05-01-2_M044.wav	05
Ses04F_script03_2_M045	 You're a mean, evil minded, little tempered witch. I hope to God I never set eyes on you again as long as I live. Whore.	Ses04F-script03-05-01-2_M045.wav	05

Ses02F_script03_1_M009	 Oh, darling, don't say that.	Ses02F-script03-01-01-1_M009.wav	01
Ses02F_script03_1_M018	 Depends on how well we've played.	Ses02F-script03-01-01-1_M018.wav	01
Ses02F_script03_1_M024	 I don't care what you do.  See, you could paint yourself green and dance naked in the Place Vendome and rush off madly with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word.  As long as you love me best.	Ses02F-script03-01-01-1_M024.wav	01
Ses02F_script03_1_M025	 You remember that awful scene we had in Venice?	Ses02F-script03-01-01-1_M025.wav	01

Ses04M_impro04_F002	 Have you gone, like, signed up with a temp agency?  Maybe they can help.	Ses04M-impro04-01-01-F002.wav	01

Ses02M_impro07_F010	 So you're going to be right here in Los Angeles; that is so cool.	Ses02M-impro07-07-01-F010.wav	07
Ses02M_impro07_F027	 Okay. Yes, totally come visit	Ses02M-impro07-07-01-F027.wav	07
Ses04M_script01_1_F035	 Are you crazy?	Ses04M-script01-05-01-1_F035.wav	05
Ses04M_script01_1_F037	 Must you be inspired?	Ses04M-script01-05-01-1_F037.wav	05
Ses02M_impro07_M014	 Hey, yes, you know that's - that's what I'm coming for.	Ses02M-impro07-07-01-M014.wav	07
Ses02M_impro07_M015	 You're half the reason I'm going. [LAUGHTER]	Ses02M-impro07-07-01-M015.wav	07
Ses02M_impro08_F025	 Right, right.	Ses02M-impro08-01-01-F025.wav	01
Ses02M_impro08_M002	 Right. No, yes I know. It is-It is a little frustrating.	Ses02M-impro08-01-01-M002.wav	01
Ses04M_script01_2_F015	 She goes to sleep in his bed and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look.  Look at it.  Joe--	Ses04M-script01-05-01-2_F015.wav	05
Ses04M_script01_2_F016	 Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand all alone	Ses04M-script01-05-01-2_F016.wav	05
Ses04M_script02_1_M014	 Right.	Ses04M-script02-01-01-1_M014.wav	01
Ses04M_script02_1_M015	 That's my point, too.	Ses04M-script02-01-01-1_M015.wav	01
Ses02M_impro08_M014	 We could mail it to you as well, but-	Ses02M-impro08-01-01-M014.wav	01
Ses02M_impro08_M015	 Right. You can go online, print it out, and just fill out the form and um- send it to us um- you know,  regarding the grievance and-	Ses02M-impro08-01-01-M015.wav	01
Ses04M_script02_2_M020	 Wait a minute, I've got it.	Ses04M-script02-01-01-2_M020.wav	01
Ses02M_impro08_M019	 Uh, I mean have you been shopping around on the Internet and stuff? I mean that you gave-	Ses02M-impro08-01-01-M019.wav	01
Ses04M_script02_2_F032	 I didn't say that.	Ses04M-script02-04-01-2_F032.wav	04
Ses02M_impro08_M026	 Okay. All right. Then we'll get it sent out there. And	Ses02M-impro08-01-01-M026.wav	01
Ses04M_script02_1_F003	 It's ours.  It's mine, too.	Ses04M-script02-05-01-1_F003.wav	05
Ses04M_script02_1_F005	 Yes.	Ses04M-script02-05-01-1_F005.wav	05
Ses04M_script02_1_F012	 I just don't.  It's stupid.	Ses04M-script02-05-01-1_F012.wav	05
Ses02M_impro08_F002	 it leads you around in circles, you can't, there is no way to like get to a real person if you don't already know how to get to there.	Ses02M-impro08-07-01-F002.wav	07
Ses02M_script01_1_F021	 From father's point of you he isn't dead and you have no right to take his girl.	Ses02M-script01-01-01-1_F021.wav	01
Ses04M_script02_2_F013	 I did want to see it.  I always do.  I keep thinking this time will be the time, but it never is.	Ses04M-script02-05-01-2_F013.wav	05
Ses04M_script02_2_F026	 I want something to turn out the way it's supposed to.	Ses04M-script02-05-01-2_F026.wav	05
Ses02M_script01_1_M026	 I wanted to get this settled first.	Ses02M-script01-01-01-1_M026.wav	01
Ses02M_script01_1_M027	 Well, if she does then that's the end of it. From her letters I think she's forgotten him.	Ses02M-script01-01-01-1_M027.wav	01
Ses04M_script02_2_F027	 This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.	Ses04M-script02-05-01-2_F027.wav	05
Ses02M_script01_2_M007	 You can't read her mind.	Ses02M-script01-01-01-2_M007.wav	01
Ses04M_script02_2_M029	 Well welcome to the human race.  You think this is what I had in mind?  You think that when I proposed, I had this great fantasy going that four years down the line, we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish?  No.	Ses04M-script02-05-01-2_M029.wav	05
Ses04M_script02_2_M031	 And we'll have three fat rosy kids and ha, ha, ha, baby, the joke's on us, 'cause you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This.	Ses04M-script02-05-01-2_M031.wav	05
Ses02M_script01_1_M003	 I don't know. When it cracked he ran into the house and cried in the kitchen.	Ses02M-script01-04-01-1_M003.wav	04
Ses02M_script01_1_M004	 No. I figured it was best to leave him alone.	Ses02M-script01-04-01-1_M004.wav	04
Ses04M_script02_1_M003	 How you doing?  Oh, no, you know what I did?  I forgot to bring my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I should have brought my flashlight.	Ses04M-script02-07-01-1_M003.wav	07
Ses04M_script02_1_M018	 Honey, this is a natural phenomenon.  I mean, this only happens once a year.  It's a great opportunity.  Think about the people in Kansas.  They'd have to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to come see this.  We're just forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up.	Ses04M-script02-07-01-1_M018.wav	07
Ses02M_script01_1_M035	 If I can't do that here well, then I'll have to get out.	Ses02M-script01-04-01-1_M035.wav	04
Ses04M_script02_1_M021	 Oh, it's a big night for these guys.  Uh, life's last orgy.	Ses04M-script02-07-01-1_M021.wav	07
Ses04M_script02_1_M022	 Yeah, they do. Okay.  But it's fish who do something none of the other fish do; like the swallows are returning to Capistrano; or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs, like that.	Ses04M-script02-07-01-1_M022.wav	07
Ses02M_script01_3_F026	 'Cause you mustn't feel that way.  Because you have a right to everything you have, Chris.  Everything, you understand that?  Me too.	Ses02M-script01-04-01-3_F026.wav	04
Ses02M_script01_3_F027	 I mean, and your money, there's- there's nothing wrong with your money.  I mean, your father put hundreds of planes in the air.  A man should be paid for that.	Ses02M-script01-04-01-3_F027.wav	04
Ses02M_script01_3_M021	 No.  Nothing like that.	Ses02M-script01-04-01-3_M021.wav	04
Ses04M_script03_1_F013	 If I laugh at everything, I must laugh at us, too.	Ses04M-script03-01-01-1_F013.wav	01
Ses02M_script01_3_M026	 Just about all.	Ses02M-script01-04-01-3_M026.wav	04
Ses02M_script01_3_M030	 I got this idea watching 'em go down.  Everything was being destroyed, see, but it seemed that one new thing was made.  A sort of responsibility.  Man for man. You know what I mean?	Ses02M-script01-04-01-3_M030.wav	04
Ses04M_script03_2_F043	 We swapped. Listen.	Ses04M-script03-01-01-2_F043.wav	01
Ses02M_script01_3_M032	 Then I came back and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here. I mean, the whole thing to them seemed like it's sort of a bus accident.  I went to work with Dad and that rat race again.	Ses02M-script01-04-01-3_M032.wav	04
Ses02M_script01_3_M033	 And I felt what you said, ashamed somehow 'cause nobody had changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book, drive the new car, see the new refrigerator.	Ses02M-script01-04-01-3_M033.wav	04
Ses02M_script01_1_F026	 Trouble is you don't see enough women, you never did.	Ses02M-script01-05-01-1_F026.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_F014	 No, thanks.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_F014.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_F017	 It's become a habit with you.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_F017.wav	05
Ses02M_script01_1_M012	 We've got to say it to him.	Ses02M-script01-05-01-1_M012.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_F023	 Oh, be quiet.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_F023.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_F032	 You always had a weak head.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_F032.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_F033	 On the contrary, a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_F033.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_F039	 Turn it on again, please.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_F039.wav	05
Ses02M_script01_2_F010	 I want you to act like he's coming back, both of you. Don't you think I haven't noticed since he invited her, I won't stand for any nonsense	Ses02M-script01-05-01-2_F010.wav	05
Ses02M_script01_3_M010	 I'm embarrassing you and I didn't want to tell it to you here.  I wanted some place we'd never been before.  A place where we'd be brand new to each other.	Ses02M-script01-07-01-3_M010.wav	07
Ses04M_script03_2_F044	 Listen, indeed.  I am sick and tired of listening to you, you damn sadistic bully.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_F044.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_F046	 Stop.  I hate you.  Do you hear me? You're conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_F046.wav	05
Ses02M_script02_1_F001	 What flashlight?	Ses02M-script02-01-01-1_F001.wav	01
Ses04M_script03_2_F050	 Marry you again? Huh.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_F050.wav	05
Ses02M_script02_1_F011	 Not particularly.	Ses02M-script02-01-01-1_F011.wav	01
Ses04M_script03_2_M008	 You must admit that he was in love with you, wasn't he?	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M008.wav	05
Ses02M_script02_2_F046	 Hmm.	Ses02M-script02-01-01-2_F046.wav	01
Ses02M_script02_2_M000	 So what do you think?	Ses02M-script02-01-01-2_M000.wav	01
Ses02M_script02_2_M001	 What I was saying.	Ses02M-script02-01-01-2_M001.wav	01
Ses04M_script03_2_M020	 Really, Amanda	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M020.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_M021	 Nothing.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M021.wav	05
Ses02M_script02_2_M025	 Get married again?	Ses02M-script02-01-01-2_M025.wav	01
Ses04M_script03_2_M034	 You must have had a riotous time.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M034.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_M035	 No restraint at all, very enjoyable.  You never had much anyhow.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M035.wav	05
Ses02M_script02_2_F018	 and I remember thinking that this is it you know. At last, at last I am as happy as I am supposed to be	Ses02M-script02-04-01-2_F018.wav	04
Ses02M_script02_2_F020	 I'd rather not remember some things. I would rather not hope for some things.	Ses02M-script02-04-01-2_F020.wav	04
Ses02M_script02_2_F022	 No.	Ses02M-script02-04-01-2_F022.wav	04
Ses02M_script02_2_F031	 Well, but this isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.	Ses02M-script02-04-01-2_F031.wav	04
Ses04M_script03_2_M046	 Turn it off.  It's driving me mad.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M046.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_M051	 You're not going like this.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M051.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_M054	 You're a mean, evil minded	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M054.wav	05
Ses02M_script02_2_M029	 Well welcome to the human race, all right. Do you think this is what I had in mind when I proposed? You think I had this great fantasy going that four years down the road we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish?	Ses02M-script02-05-01-2_M029.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_1_F006	 Behave exquisitely.	Ses04M-script03-07-01-1_F006.wav	07
Ses04M_script03_1_F008	 But what's so horrible is that one can't stay happy.	Ses04M-script03-07-01-1_F008.wav	07
Ses04M_script03_1_F017	 What happens if one of us dies?  Does the one that's left, still laugh?	Ses04M-script03-07-01-1_F017.wav	07
Ses02M_script02_1_M014	 Oh, a six-pack, that's, should've brought a -- a six-pack be just the ticket right now. How could I forget,	Ses02M-script02-07-01-1_M014.wav	07
Ses02M_script02_1_M023	 Honey, this is a natural phenomenon. I mean it only happens once a year.	Ses02M-script02-07-01-1_M023.wav	07
Ses04M_script03_1_M021	 Let's savor the delight of the moment.  Come and kiss me, darling, before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.	Ses04M-script03-07-01-1_M021.wav	07
Ses02M_script02_2_M019	 It was in the car, right? Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker you said, let's get some champagne and I said times are wasting or something like that, right?	Ses02M-script02-07-01-2_M019.wav	07
Ses05F_impro01_F008	 So could I maybe get the form from you, fill it out here- and maybe you could-	Ses05F-impro01-01-01-F008.wav	01
Ses05F_impro02_M000	 What is it?	Ses05F-impro02-01-01-M000.wav	01
Ses05F_impro02_F002	 I'm sorry.  It's just a lot ahh to explain. ahh I got a call--	Ses05F-impro02-04-01-F002.wav	04
Ses02M_script03_2_F015	 No I'm just making myself fascinating for you.	Ses02M-script03-01-01-2_F015.wav	01
Ses02M_script03_2_F024	 Yes, I did quite a lot.	Ses02M-script03-01-01-2_F024.wav	01
Ses05F_impro02_F004	 I got a call today,	Ses05F-impro02-04-01-F004.wav	04
Ses05F_impro02_F010	 I know.  Well, we'll have to figure all that out.  I mean, I think the Army's going to provide childcare and help us out with that. um.	Ses05F-impro02-04-01-F010.wav	04
Ses05F_impro02_F011	 Iraq.	Ses05F-impro02-04-01-F011.wav	04
Ses02M_script03_2_M024	 Tell me, did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?	Ses02M-script03-01-01-2_M024.wav	01
Ses05F_impro02_F031	 I'm going to miss their first words.	Ses05F-impro02-04-01-F031.wav	04
Ses02M_script03_2_F014	 What?	Ses02M-script03-05-01-2_F014.wav	05
Ses05F_impro02_F035	 "sigh" Three weeks.	Ses05F-impro02-04-01-F035.wav	04
Ses02M_script03_2_F037	 Listen indeed. I'm sick and tired of listening to you, damn sadistic bully.	Ses02M-script03-05-01-2_F037.wav	05
Ses02M_script03_2_F039	 This is the end, do you hear? The end finally and forever.	Ses02M-script03-05-01-2_F039.wav	05
Ses02M_script03_2_F042	 You're a beast. I hate you. Stop it. Stop it.	Ses02M-script03-05-01-2_F042.wav	05
Ses05F_impro02_M032	 I don't know.	Ses05F-impro02-04-01-M032.wav	04
Ses05F_impro02_M041	 I love you.	Ses05F-impro02-04-01-M041.wav	04
Ses05F_impro02_M015	 It doesn't make any sense.  It's stupid.  I told you you shouldn't go in the Army.	Ses05F-impro02-05-01-M015.wav	05
Ses05F_impro03_F004	 Uh-huh.	Ses05F-impro03-07-01-F004.wav	07
Ses02M_script03_2_M047	 I wouldn't marry you again if you came to me on your bended knees. You're a evil minded little vampire. I hope to God I never see you again as long as I live.	Ses02M-script03-05-01-2_M047.wav	05
Ses05F_impro03_F007	 I know me neither.	Ses05F-impro03-07-01-F007.wav	07

Ses03F_impro02_F019	 But it- it is for a year.	Ses03F-impro02-04-01-F019.wav	04
Ses03F_impro02_F021	 You know as much as -as much as me that I-I want to stay here with you and Amy so bad, but I can't.	Ses03F-impro02-04-01-F021.wav	04
Ses05F_impro03_M051	 I think so, too.  Are you going to get a house or-	Ses05F-impro03-07-01-M051.wav	07

Ses03F_impro02_F032	 I will come back.	Ses03F-impro02-04-01-F032.wav	04
Ses05F_impro04_M007	 No, it doesn't pay the bills, but it would pay something.  And it would help you get somewhere else.	Ses05F-impro04-01-01-M007.wav	01
Ses05F_impro04_M008	 and No, I understand, but you've got to start somewhere.  It's better than nothing and that's all you have.  You have nothing right now.	Ses05F-impro04-01-01-M008.wav	01
Ses05F_impro04_M011	 Well, you know what?  Life gets humili... humiliating at times.	Ses05F-impro04-01-01-M011.wav	01
Ses05F_impro04_M015	 If it's rent or something like that, I mean I can help you out a little bit, if- if that will help you you know stick with it.	Ses05F-impro04-01-01-M015.wav	01
