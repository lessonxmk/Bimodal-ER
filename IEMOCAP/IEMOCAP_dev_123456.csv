Ses04M_script01_2_F010	 Because she knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my worst moments, I think of her waiting and I know, again, that I'm right.	Ses04M-script01-05-01-2_F010.wav	05
Ses01F_impro05_M023	 Actually, we are not necessarily liable to give you- to even give you this fifty dollars so... it's actually- it's actually really	Ses01F-impro05-01-01-M023.wav	01
Ses05F_impro07_M036	 Oh God, it's awesome... There's going to be tons of places. [garbage]	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-M036.wav	07
Ses01F_script01_3_M032	 To bring that on to the earth again, you know, is like some kind of monument and I thought I would just make a difference to them.	Ses01F-script01-04-01-3_M032.wav	04
Ses05F_script02_2_F029	 I didn't say that.	Ses05F-script02-04-01-2_F029.wav	04

Ses01M_script01_1_F030	 That's a good answer but it doesn't answer anything.  You haven't seen her since you went away to war, it's been five years.	Ses01M-script01-05-01-1_F030.wav	05
Ses01M_script02_1_F005	 You keep saying "my flashlight" like somehow it's just yours. How's that supposed to make me feel?	Ses01M-script02-05-01-1_F005.wav	05
Ses03M_impro02_M028	 Well that's the kind of work I'm in honey.	Ses03M-impro02-04-01-M028.wav	04

Ses01F_impro05_M009	 Yeah. Yeah, I don't see- I don't see any--	Ses01F-impro05-01-01-M009.wav	01
Ses04F_script03_1_F029	 How ridiculous.  How utterly, utterly ridiculous.	Ses04F-script03-07-01-1_F029.wav	07
Ses04F_impro02_M021	 Yeah.  Of course I do because I didn't enlist in this stupid thing.  Why don't you just get out now and then-	Ses04F-impro02-05-01-M021.wav	05
Ses02F_script03_1_M025	 You remember that awful scene we had in Venice?	Ses02F-script03-01-01-1_M025.wav	01

Ses02F_impro08_F016	 Great.  How many seats?	Ses02F-impro08-01-01-F016.wav	01
Ses03F_script03_2_F023	 I don't care. I don't care, do you understand? I don't care if they bark, if they roll over on the floor like hoops.	Ses03F-script03-05-01-2_F023.wav	05
Ses03M_script02_2_F018	 We thought I was pregnant.	Ses03M-script02-04-01-2_F018.wav	04
Ses02F_script03_2_F040	 This is the end.  Finally and forever.  Do you hear me?  The end.	Ses02F-script03-05-01-2_F040.wav	05
Ses01M_script01_1_M041	 I am thinking like that.	Ses01M-script01-05-01-1_M041.wav	05
Ses04M_impro07_F026	 Okay.  Well that's cool, too, but like--	Ses04M-impro07-01-01-F026.wav	01
Ses05M_script03_1_M023	 [garbage] Darling, kiss me before your body rots and worms start popping in and out of your eye sockets.	Ses05M-script03-07-01-1_M023.wav	07
Ses04F_script02_2_F020	 and you popped the cork and while we were dancing, you said the softest most intimate things to me	Ses04F-script02-04-01-2_F020.wav	04

Ses01F_script02_2_F016	 For God's sake, this is not about fish.	Ses01F-script02-05-01-2_F016.wav	05
Ses05F_impro01_F017	 Isn't there anything you can do?  Just call over and ask them if I can go to the front of the line in the other line.	Ses05F-impro01-05-01-F017.wav	05
Ses03M_impro01_F000	 Is that a demand sir?	Ses03M-impro01-01-01-F000.wav	01
Ses05F_impro05_F018	 Uh- Not lose the baggage in the first place. I mean You're offering a service here. I paid so much money for that ticket.	Ses05F-impro05-05-01-F018.wav	05
Ses05M_impro05_F004	 So, within the country, though? umm	Ses05M-impro05-01-01-F004.wav	01
Ses02M_impro03_F011	 Oh, You did not.	Ses02M-impro03-07-01-F011.wav	07
Ses05F_impro03_M035	 [BREATHING]	Ses05F-impro03-07-01-M035.wav	07
Ses01M_script03_2_M043	 Shut up. Shut up. I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling back to me on a bended knee. You are an evil tempered little vampire and I never want to see you again as long as I live.	Ses01M-script03-05-01-2_M043.wav	05
Ses03M_impro05b_M024	 in all thousand flights I've been on probably I can't even count how many flights I've been on.  This has never happened before.	Ses03M-impro05b-05-01-M024.wav	05
Ses02M_script02_1_F005	 Yea.	Ses02M-script02-01-01-1_F005.wav	01
Ses01M_script02_1_F017	 Pass what up?  These little fish swim out of the ocean, they flop around on the sand then they swim back and then they die.	Ses01M-script02-05-01-1_F017.wav	05
Ses02F_script01_3_M030	 You know what I mean?  To show that, to bring that onto the Earth again, like some kind of monument and everyone would feel it standing behind him and it would make a difference to him.	Ses02F-script01-04-01-3_M030.wav	04
Ses05F_impro07_F033	 [LAUGHTER]	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-F033.wav	07

Ses03M_impro05b_F010	 No actually it was...this is the first time this has ever happened.  I don't know what happened--	Ses03M-impro05b-01-01-F010.wav	01
Ses02F_script01_3_F022	 It wouldn't work this way.	Ses02F-script01-04-01-3_F022.wav	04
Ses04F_impro03_F007	 Well actually we were just talking about today and I don't really want to do like the traditional church thing, you know.  So we are going to get married in the meadow.	Ses04F-impro03-07-01-F007.wav	07

Ses05F_impro02_F037	 Yeah.	Ses05F-impro02-04-01-F037.wav	04
Ses02M_script03_2_M047	 I wouldn't marry you again if you came to me on your bended knees. You're a evil minded little vampire. I hope to God I never see you again as long as I live.	Ses02M-script03-05-01-2_M047.wav	05

Ses02F_script02_2_M019	 It was in the car, right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, "let's get some champagne," and I said, "time's a wasting" or something like that, right?	Ses02F-script02-01-01-2_M019.wav	01
Ses02F_script02_2_M001	 What I was saying.	Ses02F-script02-01-01-2_M001.wav	01

Ses05F_script01_2_F012	 Laugh.  Laugh at me, but what happens the night that she goes to sleep in his bed, and his memorial breaks in pieces?	Ses05F-script01-05-01-2_F012.wav	05
Ses05M_script03_1_M011	 Being that sacred and wonderful thing, love.	Ses05M-script03-07-01-1_M011.wav	07
Ses03M_impro08a_F014	 I want to talk to a supervisor	Ses03M-impro08a-05-01-F014.wav	05

Ses04M_script01_2_F014	 Laugh.  Laugh at me.  But why did that happen the very night that she came here?	Ses04M-script01-05-01-2_F014.wav	05
Ses01M_script02_1_M032	 It's like a little bit of the unexplainable, a little magic, a little mystery.  I just don't see how you can not be interested in this.	Ses01M-script02-07-01-1_M032.wav	07
Ses03F_script02_1_M011	 Hey, do they always run during a full moon? I can't remember if it was full last year. Do you remember?	Ses03F-script02-07-01-1_M011.wav	07
Ses03M_script02_2_M033	 Right.	Ses03M-script02-05-01-2_M033.wav	05

Ses02F_script02_1_M000	 What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight.	Ses02F-script02-07-01-1_M000.wav	07
Ses05M_script02_2_F010	 No, we won't.  It's like waiting up for Santa Clause or something.  I feel like as though my whole life is going to be standing on the beach waiting with my eyes opened expectantly, my hands clasped neatly in front of me, waiting for fish to show up.  And the fish will not show up.	Ses05M-script02-05-01-2_F010.wav	05
Ses04F_impro07_M000	 Hey, what's up?	Ses04F-impro07-01-01-M000.wav	01

Ses04M_script02_1_M002	 Is that, is that - is that just foam?  I can't even tell.  Although, if you can't tell, it's probably isn't them.  It'll probably be unmistakable, don't you think?	Ses04M-script02-07-01-1_M002.wav	07
Ses03M_script02_2_M014	 Well, we're going to see it.	Ses03M-script02-01-01-2_M014.wav	01

Ses05F_impro05_M005	 It seems like it went through Heath Row.  I see it here. uh-	Ses05F-impro05-01-01-M005.wav	01
Ses05F_script03_2_M025	 I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more then.	Ses05F-script03-05-01-2_M025.wav	05
Ses04M_script01_1_F028	 The trouble is, you don't see enough women.  You never did.	Ses04M-script01-01-01-1_F028.wav	01

Ses05F-impro08-05-01-M005.wav	05
Ses05F_impro04_M022	 Well, exactly.  Money is not everything.	Ses05F-impro04-01-01-M022.wav	01
Ses05M_script03_2_F004	 Oh, maybe a little.  Nothing serious.	Ses05M-script03-01-01-2_F004.wav	01
Ses01F_impro07_F005	 I know. We should throw a party.	Ses01F-impro07-07-01-F005.wav	07
Ses04F_script02_2_M047	 It's not champagne.	Ses04F-script02-01-01-2_M047.wav	01

Ses02F_impro06_F004	 I just don't want him to be gone.	Ses02F-impro06-04-01-F004.wav	04
Ses05M_script02_1_M032	 they just all as one turn around and start swimming to this very point where we are standing now for one last celebration of sex and death. God, it's giving me Goosebumps.  Look at all the hairs that are standing up.	Ses05M-script02-07-01-1_M032.wav	07
Ses03F_impro06_F029	 Yeah. But then when he got cancer and it got bad, you know, she just took off and-	Ses03F-impro06-04-01-F029.wav	04
Ses01M_impro05_M015	 Okay.	Ses01M-impro05-01-01-M015.wav	01

Ses05F_impro03_M033	 Oh, did she cry?	Ses05F-impro03-07-01-M033.wav	07
Ses03F_script03_2_F008	 Well, it's true.	Ses03F-script03-01-01-2_F008.wav	01
Ses02F_script02_2_F018	 And I remember thinking, this is it.  You know, at last--at last I am as happy as I am supposed to be.	Ses02F-script02-04-01-2_F018.wav	04

Ses01F_impro06_F024	 And the last time before she died, I remember she couldn't really stand, umm...	Ses01F-impro06-04-01-F024.wav	04
Ses04M_impro07_F015	 Everything in LA is twenty minutes away.	Ses04M-impro07-07-01-F015.wav	07

Ses05M_impro06_F009	 Yeah. I understand.  I think it's really healthy to grieve.	Ses05M-impro06-04-01-F009.wav	04
Ses03F_script01_3_F032	 And you still feel that way?	Ses03F-script01-04-01-3_F032.wav	04
Ses05F_impro04_M020	 It's the way it seems to me.  You started complaining about not being able to find a job the first day you went out and didn't find a job.  And I'm not saying like and not trying to you know put you down or anything, it's just that-	Ses05F-impro04-01-01-M020.wav	01

Ses04M_impro07_M035	 No, I'm not going to go to a football game.	Ses04M-impro07-01-01-M035.wav	01
Ses02M_script01_1_M026	 I wanted to get this settled first.	Ses02M-script01-01-01-1_M026.wav	01
Ses03F_script03_2_F037	 I will not. Go away. Go away. I hate you.	Ses03F-script03-05-01-2_F037.wav	05
Ses04F_impro07_F036	 [LAUGHTER]	Ses04F-impro07-07-01-F036.wav	07

Ses04F_impro07_F052	 I know.  Right down the street.	Ses04F-impro07-07-01-F052.wav	07
Ses05F_impro04_F038	 Well, I'd like to be a working actor.	Ses05F-impro04-01-01-F038.wav	01
Ses03F_impro03_M005	 yeah [LAUGHTER]	Ses03F-impro03-07-01-M005.wav	07

Ses03M_impro03_M001	 Esmeralda, guess what?	Ses03M-impro03-07-01-M001.wav	07

Ses05M_script03_1_M021	 No, no that is quit laughable.  The cutting little mystery all done with mirrors.	Ses05M-script03-07-01-1_M021.wav	07
Ses03M_impro05b_F000	 Can I help you sir?	Ses03M-impro05b-01-01-F000.wav	01
Ses02M_script02_1_M005	 Although, I guess you can't tell it probably isn't them. Probably be unmistakable don't you think?	Ses02M-script02-07-01-1_M005.wav	07
Ses05M_impro08_M020	 Well, if it does happen again, let me give you my direct number and you can call me.  Actually, I'll give you my cell number. Um- It's --	Ses05M-impro08-01-01-M020.wav	01
Ses04F_impro03_F036	 Yes.	Ses04F-impro03-07-01-F036.wav	07
Ses05M_impro07_F017	 Good tradeoff	Ses05M-impro07-01-01-F017.wav	01
Ses01M_impro03_F002	 Why?	Ses01M-impro03-07-01-F002.wav	07
Ses01M_script01_3_M027	 Pretty much all.	Ses01M-script01-04-01-3_M027.wav	04
Ses01F_impro03_M020	 But the pennies always get you because you end up spending like, you know, fifty bucks.	Ses01F-impro03-01-01-M020.wav	01
Ses04F_impro03_F042	 Just couldn't be any cooler.	Ses04F-impro03-07-01-F042.wav	07
Ses03M_impro01_M029	 What is wrong with you?	Ses03M-impro01-05-01-M029.wav	05

Ses04F_impro05_F014	 You have to make amends for what you did for losing my bag and all of my stuff.  Fifty dollars is unacceptable.	Ses04F-impro05-05-01-F014.wav	05
Ses03F_impro02_M016	 You can't leave your daughter alone like this.	Ses03F-impro02-04-01-M016.wav	04
Ses03F_script01_3_M030	 Well, I lost them.	Ses03F-script01-04-01-3_M030.wav	04
Ses03M_script02_1_M043	 About what I just said?	Ses03M-script02-07-01-1_M043.wav	07
Ses03M_script03_1_F018	 That's serious enough.	Ses03M-script03-04-01-1_F018.wav	04
Ses05F_impro03_M020	 Am I in it?	Ses05F-impro03-07-01-M020.wav	07
Ses03M_script03_2_M030	 Okay, like I mentioned before I had three very small, minute liquor glasses of brandy.  That's not even enough to get a child of two drunk.	Ses03M-script03-05-01-2_M030.wav	05
Ses05F_script01_1_F006	 He is thinking about him again.	Ses05F-script01-04-01-1_F006.wav	04
Ses01M_script02_1_F022	 Last year, you'll also remember we got--our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat, we got into a big fight and we did not see the grunions.	Ses01M-script02-05-01-1_F022.wav	05
Ses02M_impro01_M018	 You- shouldn't you have like a sign or something maybe like up on the counter when you get the applica- maybe on the application	Ses02M-impro01-05-01-M018.wav	05
Ses02F_impro08_M018	 All right.  So we're confirmed then or do you--All right.	Ses02F-impro08-01-01-M018.wav	01
Ses01M_impro05_M023	 Yeah it's really unfortunate you know why because I'm going to get fired if I don't get that.  So I need to have that back.	Ses01M-impro05-05-01-M023.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_1_M021	 Let's savor the delight of the moment.  Come and kiss me, darling, before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.	Ses04M-script03-07-01-1_M021.wav	07
Ses01M_script01_1_M023	 To hell with that.	Ses01M-script01-05-01-1_M023.wav	05
Ses03M_script03_2_F001	 Presents?  A trivial little broach.	Ses03M-script03-05-01-2_F001.wav	05
Ses01F_script02_2_M000	 Look at this, all of the hairs are standing up on my arm.	Ses01F-script02-07-01-2_M000.wav	07
Ses02F_script01_3_M029	 I got this idea watching them go down.  Everything was being destroyed, see, but it seemed that there was one new thing being made.  A sort of responsibility.  Man for man.	Ses02F-script01-04-01-3_M029.wav	04
Ses03M_impro05a_M020	 What is the matter with you?	Ses03M-impro05a-05-01-M020.wav	05
Ses03F_impro04_M017	 Maybe you could start teaching. I don't know.	Ses03F-impro04-01-01-M017.wav	01
Ses05F_impro04_F039	 But um--	Ses05F-impro04-01-01-F039.wav	01
Ses03M_script02_1_M035	 You know, this is great isn't it?  You know, I wouldn't trade this for anything.	Ses03M-script02-07-01-1_M035.wav	07
Ses02F_impro03_M018	 Yeah, that is--how long you guys been together now?	Ses02F-impro03-01-01-M018.wav	01

Ses02F_impro03_F009	 like all they have And I was like, what's going on?  And he like takes my hand and pulls me into the middle and he's like--you know, get's on his knee and everything--And says will you marry me? And I flipped out.	Ses02F-impro03-07-01-F009.wav	07
Ses01M_impro05_F028	 That's unfortunate.	Ses01M-impro05-01-01-F028.wav	01
Ses01F_script01_3_M028	 You can't just toss off a thing like that because they weren't just men. You know?	Ses01F-script01-04-01-3_M028.wav	04
Ses01F_script02_1_M011	 Of course, our flashlight.  What's yours is mine.  Me flashlight es su flashlight.	Ses01F-script02-01-01-1_M011.wav	01
Ses01F_script01_3_M023	 Yeah.  I suppose I have been. But it's going from me.	Ses01F-script01-04-01-3_M023.wav	04
Ses05M_impro08_M009	 Okay.  Is it being- Is it being compressed between anything by any chance?  Because sometimes your connection can be you know, disrupted by, you know, the cable being squished.	Ses05M-impro08-01-01-M009.wav	01
Ses01M_impro03_M013	 Oh good idea.	Ses01M-impro03-07-01-M013.wav	07
Ses02F_impro07_F017	 Because, I don't have to like make that decision anymore.  I don't have to try and decide, like, what the bad school I'm going to go to is. you know	Ses02F-impro07-07-01-F017.wav	07
Ses01M_impro03_M000	 The craziest thing just happened to me.	Ses01M-impro03-07-01-M000.wav	07
Ses02M_impro05_F017	 We have very tight security but we -uh- there are times when we just can't uh make sure there aren't absolutely no human error, you know	Ses02M-impro05-01-01-F017.wav	01
Ses01M_impro07_F022	 Who do you play? Like do--are you like... nationally ranked?	Ses01M-impro07-07-01-F022.wav	07

Ses03F_script03_2_M016	 Nothing.	Ses03F-script03-05-01-2_M016.wav	05
Ses05M_impro05_F014	 Um, well, there's not much I can do.  I can, you can file this report and we'll call you when it comes in.	Ses05M-impro05-01-01-F014.wav	01
Ses03M_script02_2_F024	 Rather not hope for something.	Ses03M-script02-04-01-2_F024.wav	04
Ses03F_script02_2_M026	 A-a back rub, some ice cream, a suicide pact. What the hell do you want, Carla?	Ses03F-script02-05-01-2_M026.wav	05
Ses05M_script02_2_F013	 Do you remember the first time that we came to see the grunion?  It was about four years ago right after we got married.  We thought I was pregnant.  We had a bottle of champagne and no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  We took off our shoes.  And while we were dancing you said the most intimate things to me right in my ear so I could feel them as much as hear them.	Ses05M-script02-04-01-2_F013.wav	04
Ses01M_impro06_M026	 For like eight years.	Ses01M-impro06-04-01-M026.wav	04

Ses05F_script01_1_M007	 I don't know the meaning of it.  But I know one thing mom did.  We made a terrible mistake with dad.	Ses05F-script01-04-01-1_M007.wav	04
Ses03F_script01_1_M029	 I wanted to get this settled first.	Ses03F-script01-01-01-1_M029.wav	01
