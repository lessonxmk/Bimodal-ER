Ses02F_script01_3_F025	 Oh, gee.	Ses02F-script01-04-01-3_F025.wav	04
Ses04F_impro06_M007	 It's sort of- it's almost better off to rest in peace than he is to live in pain.	Ses04F-impro06-01-01-M007.wav	01
Ses04M_script01_2_F018	 You, above all, have got to believe.  You.	Ses04M-script01-05-01-2_F018.wav	05
Ses04F_impro06_M014	 So-	Ses04F-impro06-04-01-M014.wav	04

Ses02F_script02_2_M029	 Well, welcome to the human race.  Do you think this is what I had in mind when I proposed?  That four years down the road, we'd be at the beach yelling at each other over fish?	Ses02F-script02-05-01-2_M029.wav	05
Ses01F_impro03_M000	 So what's up?  What's new?	Ses01F-impro03-01-01-M000.wav	01
Ses03F_impro01_M002	 You didn't fill this out right. All right. It says that you have to fill out the back sheet of this, but you filled out the yellow sheet of it.	Ses03F-impro01-01-01-M002.wav	01
Ses01F_impro05_M030	 Right now all I can do is just give you this fifty dollars, I'm really sorry.	Ses01F-impro05-01-01-M030.wav	01
Ses01M_script03_2_M033	 Well then you'll wake the people downstairs.	Ses01M-script03-05-01-2_M033.wav	05

Ses02M_impro03_M018	 No, but it was good.	Ses02M-impro03-07-01-M018.wav	07
Ses01M_script02_1_M028	 People in Kansas would have to get plane tickets and make hotel reservations to see this.  It's only forty minutes away; it's just too good to pass up.	Ses01M-script02-05-01-1_M028.wav	05
Ses05M_script02_2_F026	 But this isn't at all what I wanted it to be.	Ses05M-script02-04-01-2_F026.wav	04
Ses03F_impro03_F024	 Yeah. I'm so excited. [LAUGHTER].	Ses03F-impro03-07-01-F024.wav	07

Ses04M_script03_2_F049	 Let go of me.  You're a cruel fiend and I hate and loath you.  Thank God, I discovered in time what you're really like.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_F049.wav	05

Ses05F_impro04_M025	 You can always stay with me if you- if you have to stay with me for a while and get yourself back up on your feet again.  You know I'm not just going to you know just throw you to the wolves or something like that.  If there's any way I can help you, I will.	Ses05F-impro04-01-01-M025.wav	01
Ses05F_script01_2_M017	 What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you, Kate?	Ses05F-script01-05-01-2_M017.wav	05
Ses03M_script01_1_M029	 Then I guess that's the end of it.	Ses03M-script01-01-01-1_M029.wav	01
Ses01F_script03_2_F035	 You are far too temperamental, try to control yourself.	Ses01F-script03-05-01-2_F035.wav	05

Ses03M_impro05b_F015	 Did you have your name tags on the luggage?	Ses03M-impro05b-01-01-F015.wav	01
Ses03M_impro08a_M012	 Um- Let me connect you to my supervisor.  Actually, he's out right now so I'm supervisor until he comes back. Um-	Ses03M-impro08a-01-01-M012.wav	01

Ses04M_impro04_M004	 there's just like no jobs available.  I mean, it's just like, God.	Ses04M-impro04-01-01-M004.wav	01
Ses03M_impro08a_M001	 I'm sorry ma'am, what can I help you with?	Ses03M-impro08a-01-01-M001.wav	01
Ses01F_script02_2_M038	 I just- I know I don't make you happy.	Ses01F-script02-04-01-2_M038.wav	04
Ses04M_impro05_M045	 So why don't we just do that and stop this nonsense, hmm?  Hmm?	Ses04M-impro05-05-01-M045.wav	05
Ses03M_impro05b_F004	 Okay.  Well you um-...	Ses03M-impro05b-01-01-F004.wav	01

Ses03F_script03_2_M041	 You know, you're a vile, ill-tempered, wicked little beast and I hope that I never see you again as long as I live.	Ses03F-script03-05-01-2_M041.wav	05
Ses03F_script01_2_F015	 Don't, don't laugh at me, don't laugh at me.	Ses03F-script01-05-01-2_F015.wav	05
Ses03F_impro08_F021	 A day?	Ses03F-impro08-01-01-F021.wav	01
Ses05M_script03_1_M007	 With the worst- with the most perfect poise?	Ses05M-script03-07-01-1_M007.wav	07
Ses03M_impro05b_M022	 Who are you going to fire because of that?	Ses03M-impro05b-05-01-M022.wav	05
Ses05M_impro04_F037	 I can't see where the issue would be. so	Ses05M-impro04-01-01-F037.wav	01
Ses04F_script02_2_M021	 That's it, right?  You want this to be like the other time, right.  That's it.	Ses04F-script02-07-01-2_M021.wav	07
Ses03F_impro07_M029	 Uh-oh.	Ses03F-impro07-07-01-M029.wav	07
Ses02F_script01_3_M022	 I don't know how to start.	Ses02F-script01-04-01-3_M022.wav	04
Ses01M_script01_1_F043	 Well, I can see that.	Ses01M-script01-05-01-1_F043.wav	05
Ses03M_script03_2_F036	 They are away in Tunis.	Ses03M-script03-01-01-2_F036.wav	01
Ses01M_script02_2_M020	 Let's see, uh, I took a shower and, um, you were watching the news and you said the "the Grunions are running tonight," and I said "okay great, let's go."	Ses01M-script02-01-01-2_M020.wav	01
Ses04F_script02_1_M021	 Think about the people in Kansas.  They'd have to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to come see this.  We're just forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up.	Ses04F-script02-07-01-1_M021.wav	07
Ses05F_impro07_F023	 [LAUGHTER] Oh, I'm going to be working too, I mean.	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-F023.wav	07
Ses05F_impro07_M001	 Shut up.  What'd you get, where'd you get accepted to? please	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-M001.wav	07
Ses02F_script02_1_M002	 I would have liked to have gone a little further up the coast to get away from the lights and the people, but I was afraid we'd miss it.	Ses02F-script02-07-01-1_M002.wav	07
Ses01M_impro02_M001	 I have to go back.	Ses01M-impro02-04-01-M001.wav	04
Ses01F_script03_1_F006	 We'll behave exquisitely.	Ses01F-script03-07-01-1_F006.wav	07
Ses04F_impro03_M039	 You're my best friend, we're growing up and now you're getting married. that's amazing	Ses04F-impro03-07-01-M039.wav	07
Ses02M_impro06_F013	 Are you going to be okay?	Ses02M-impro06-04-01-F013.wav	04
Ses03M_script01_1_M003	 I don't know. But after it cracked he ran back into the house and he cried in the kitchen.	Ses03M-script01-04-01-1_M003.wav	04
Ses01M_impro03_F022	 How exciting.  You should make her bring all your friends too.	Ses01M-impro03-07-01-F022.wav	07
Ses05M_script03_1_M021	 No, no that is quit laughable.  The cutting little mystery all done with mirrors.	Ses05M-script03-07-01-1_M021.wav	07
Ses03M_impro08b_M000	 Hello?	Ses03M-impro08b-01-01-M000.wav	01

Ses04M_script03_2_M049	 You're a vile tempered, loosed living	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M049.wav	05
Ses01M_script01_1_F008	 He's dreaming about him again, walking the streets.	Ses01M-script01-05-01-1_F008.wav	05
Ses04F_impro04_F031	 I thought I was pretty clear about what the problem was.	Ses04F-impro04-05-01-F031.wav	05
Ses03M_impro05b_M013	 Wow.  Thank you.  Holiday Inn.  Wow.  Thank...the flight cost five hundred dollars.	Ses03M-impro05b-05-01-M013.wav	05
Ses05F_impro06_F006	 It's hard to watch when it's painful for them, you know.	Ses05F-impro06-04-01-F006.wav	04
Ses04F_impro03_F001	 It's really exciting.  Don't you want to guess?	Ses04F-impro03-07-01-F001.wav	07
Ses02M_impro06_M009	 not being able to see anyone again, who knows where they really went, you know. I mean, I guess we can just hope that wherever they are now if it's anywhere that it's better I mean.	Ses02M-impro06-04-01-M009.wav	04
Ses03F_impro06_F010	 It's weird, I think. I feel so alone, you know? What am I going to do now? Now that he's gone.	Ses03F-impro06-04-01-F010.wav	04
Ses05F_impro05_M007	 I'm not sure where it is.  We can absolutely keep an eye out for for it for you.	Ses05F-impro05-01-01-M007.wav	01
Ses01M_impro07_F027	 I am not saying you should be. I'm not no. I think it's great I think you should be incredibly proud yourself especially because you're going to U.S.C for free for doing it. For free.	Ses01M-impro07-07-01-F027.wav	07
Ses02M_script01_3_F025	 Do you still feel that way?	Ses02M-script01-04-01-3_F025.wav	04
Ses04M_script03_1_F005	 Oh, it sent shivers up my spine.	Ses04M-script03-07-01-1_F005.wav	07
Ses05M_script03_1_F017	 What if one of us dies, does the other one laugh then?	Ses05M-script03-01-01-1_F017.wav	01
Ses05M_impro08_F006	 Pretty much, yeah - I don't know if it's, like, bad phone lines or something.	Ses05M-impro08-01-01-F006.wav	01
Ses03M_impro06_F019	 I would've loved to.	Ses03M-impro06-04-01-F019.wav	04
Ses04F_script02_2_F024	 I would rather not remember some things.  I would rather not hope for some things.	Ses04F-script02-04-01-2_F024.wav	04
Ses04M_impro06_M011	 This is just -- this is a terrible life.  I just don't understand.	Ses04M-impro06-04-01-M011.wav	04
Ses05F_script03_2_F006	 Well, I- he got a lot of pleasure out of it and it didn't hurt me.	Ses05F-script03-01-01-2_F006.wav	01
Ses03M_impro05a_F012	 I'm very sorry but let's check on this immediately.  This is definitely an emergency.  It seems--	Ses03M-impro05a-01-01-F012.wav	01
Ses01F_impro05_M023	 Actually, we are not necessarily liable to give you- to even give you this fifty dollars so... it's actually- it's actually really	Ses01F-impro05-01-01-M023.wav	01
Ses03F_script02_1_M017	 Do you want my jacket?	Ses03F-script02-01-01-1_M017.wav	01

Ses01M_script01_3_F026	 Do you still feel that way?	Ses01M-script01-04-01-3_F026.wav	04
Ses04M_script02_1_M001	 Actually, I wanted to go a little farther up the coast, get away from the lights and the people, but I was afraid we'd miss it.  How you doing?	Ses04M-script02-07-01-1_M001.wav	07

Ses01F_impro04_F033	 I can not-- you are not here by choice.  Nobody would ride this bus by choice.	Ses01F-impro04-05-01-F033.wav	05
Ses04F_impro04_M020	 and I want- I mean you know you've got to, like, do your hair.  I mean- I don't know, it's like,	Ses04F-impro04-01-01-M020.wav	01
Ses03M_script03_2_M038	 No I'll do no such thing.	Ses03M-script03-05-01-2_M038.wav	05
Ses01M_script02_2_F011	 I just, we just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like.	Ses01M-script02-05-01-2_F011.wav	05
Ses02F_impro07_F022	 ...because also on the list of their, um, like G.E.'s or whatever, you have a lot of choices within every single one.  So you can, like, try things out and not just be like, oh, I have to take math, oh, I have to take this.  You know what I mean?	Ses02F-impro07-07-01-F022.wav	07
Ses05F_script03_2_F021	 I don't care if they bark and roll around like hoops, okay.	Ses05F-script03-05-01-2_F021.wav	05
Ses03F_impro02_F024	 But she has you. I mean, that's what you're there for. You're my right-hand man.	Ses03F-impro02-04-01-F024.wav	04
Ses05F_impro05_M015	 Sentimental value.	Ses05F-impro05-01-01-M015.wav	01
Ses05F_script01_3_M033	 And to show that-to-to bring that back onto the earth again like a- like a monument.  And everyone would have it standing behind them and- and it would make a difference for them.	Ses05F-script01-04-01-3_M033.wav	04
Ses02F_script03_1_M014	 Flippancy brings out the acid in their damn sweetness and light.	Ses02F-script03-01-01-1_M014.wav	01
Ses05F_script01_1_M006	 I guess, he is.	Ses05F-script01-04-01-1_M006.wav	04
Ses01M_impro06_M009	 No.	Ses01M-impro06-04-01-M009.wav	04

Ses03M_script03_2_F029	 You're quite insufferable.  I expect it's because you're drunk.	Ses03M-script03-05-01-2_F029.wav	05

Ses03M_script03_2_M030	 Okay, like I mentioned before I had three very small, minute liquor glasses of brandy.  That's not even enough to get a child of two drunk.	Ses03M-script03-05-01-2_M030.wav	05
Ses01F_script02_2_M047	 Do you want to go home?  Are you cold?	Ses01F-script02-01-01-2_M047.wav	01
Ses05M_script03_1_F002	 What do we do?	Ses05M-script03-07-01-1_F002.wav	07

Ses05M_script02_2_M025	 Do you think that I thought there would be times when you would look at me like I was used Kleenex or I would look at you and think, good God, when's the next flight to Alaska?  No.  No, I'm just like you. I thought it would all be like peaches and roses, and sand in our toes, and wind in our hair, and the fish would always come.  And the bills would magically pay themselves.  And we'd have three fat rosy kids.  But, ha ha, baby, the jokes on us!	Ses05M-script02-05-01-2_M025.wav	05

Ses03F_impro04_M012	 What would you do- What would you do if you didn't? You can go to law school.	Ses03F-impro04-01-01-M012.wav	01
Ses01F_script02_1_M029	 There's like mystery here, there's magic.  It's like a little bit of the unexplainable.  I just can't see how you're not interested.	Ses01F-script02-01-01-1_M029.wav	01
Ses02M_script02_1_M038	 they don't why, we don't know why. They didn't take a vote or anything; they didn't get a map or an invitation.	Ses02M-script02-07-01-1_M038.wav	07

Ses03F_impro08_F014	 And we will probably send you a calling card.  I'm very sorry.  You're just going to have to be patient, sir.	Ses03F-impro08-01-01-F014.wav	01
Ses02M_impro08_M025	 Yes, um but  for- for that- for that charge we will need you to send something in but we can get you processed immediately for this, for this, for this new card. It still goes to the same address, right?	Ses02M-impro08-01-01-M025.wav	01

Ses04F_impro05_F009	 You're kidding me, right.  You're going to give me fifty dollars to completely cover my bag, everything that was in it, the inconvenience that I've gone through.  I paid for my ticket.  All I expect is to safely get to my destination with my stuff.  Is that so much to ask?  I mean I really don't think that's that big a deal to ask you guys to have my bag in the place where I leave and then put my bag where I end up.	Ses04F-impro05-05-01-F009.wav	05
Ses02M_script01_2_M016	 What does that mean, me above all?	Ses02M-script01-05-01-2_M016.wav	05

Ses05F_script01_2_F014	 Only last week, another boy turned up in Detroit, been missing longer than Larry, you read it yourself.	Ses05F-script01-05-01-2_F014.wav	05
Ses04F_script01_1_M010	 I don't want to argue with him but it's time that he realizes that Larry's not coming back anymore.	Ses04F-script01-05-01-1_M010.wav	05
Ses04F_script01_1_F012	 You can't say that to him.	Ses04F-script01-05-01-1_F012.wav	05
Ses01F_impro03_F015	 Yeah, so [LAUGHTER] He's calling me now	Ses01F-impro03-07-01-F015.wav	07
Ses01M_script02_2_M037	 No, no I'm just like you, I thought it was going to be all rosy cheeks and the bills would pay themselves and fish will always come and--	Ses01M-script02-04-01-2_M037.wav	04
Ses05M_impro04_F028	 Well, maybe we can find you something with juggling.	Ses05M-impro04-01-01-F028.wav	01
Ses04F_script01_3_M041	 I felt wrong to be alive, to open the new bank book, to drive the new car, to see the new refrigerator.	Ses04F-script01-04-01-3_M041.wav	04
Ses04M_impro06_F009	 Well I know it's not a lot of help or anything, but at least you got to know him.  I mean, at least you had the time with him that you did.	Ses04M-impro06-04-01-F009.wav	04
Ses03M_impro06_M029	 He actually wanted to do something.	Ses03M-impro06-04-01-M029.wav	04
Ses05M_script01_1b_F026	 Well, that's a good reason.  But it don't mean a thing. I mean, You haven't seen her since you went to war.  It's been five years.	Ses05M-script01-01-01-1b_F026.wav	01
Ses03F_impro04_M017	 Maybe you could start teaching. I don't know.	Ses03F-impro04-01-01-M017.wav	01
Ses02M_impro06_M018	 Then she's gone.	Ses02M-impro06-04-01-M018.wav	04
Ses03F_script01_3_F008	 Well, you've been embarrassed ever since I came.	Ses03F-script01-04-01-3_F008.wav	04
Ses03F_impro05_M014	 What, do you have questions?	Ses03F-impro05-01-01-M014.wav	01
Ses05M_impro05_F015	 wow.	Ses05M-impro05-01-01-F015.wav	01
Ses04M_impro04_F006	 Well then you're choosing to be unemployed, really.	Ses04M-impro04-01-01-F006.wav	01
Ses05F_impro02_F036	 Yeah.	Ses05F-impro02-04-01-F036.wav	04
Ses04F_script01_3_M004	 What?	Ses04F-script01-05-01-3_M004.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_F035	 Not very funny, dear.  You'd better have some more brandy.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_F035.wav	05
Ses03F_impro07_M001	 I'm all right.	Ses03F-impro07-01-01-M001.wav	01
Ses04M_script01_2_F009	 Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men.  Why hasn't she married?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she's waited.	Ses04M-script01-05-01-2_F009.wav	05
Ses02F_script03_1_M031	 I didn't hit you very hard.	Ses02F-script03-01-01-1_M031.wav	01
Ses04F_script02_1_M010	 Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  We should have brought the blanket, our blanket.	Ses04F-script02-01-01-1_M010.wav	01
Ses01M_impro06_F023	 Mmhmm.	Ses01M-impro06-01-01-F023.wav	01
Ses01M_script02_1_M044	 And form the line and started swimming, swimming that would bring them to this point here...	Ses01M-script02-07-01-1_M044.wav	07
Ses04F_impro07_M071	 Yeah, you don't want to do the sorority thing because you'll probably get used and abused by	Ses04F-impro07-01-01-M071.wav	01
Ses04M_script03_2_F048	 Oh, yes, I am.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_F048.wav	05
Ses02F_script03_2_F043	 Thank God I realized what you are-- I'd never marry you again ever in my life. You're a cruel fiend and I hate you. You're a beast. You're a beast--I hate you. Stop it.  Stop it.	Ses02F-script03-05-01-2_F043.wav	05
Ses04F_impro04_M014	 Yeah, I understand, but-	Ses04F-impro04-01-01-M014.wav	01
Ses04F_script03_1_M029	 Horrible thing.  I hated it.	Ses04F-script03-01-01-1_M029.wav	01
Ses03M_script03_2_F000	 Oh, come on, you knew there was nothing in that.	Ses03M-script03-01-01-2_F000.wav	01
Ses03M_impro04_F001	 Well have you been trying to get a job, look for a job or...?	Ses03M-impro04-01-01-F001.wav	01
Ses01M_impro03_F010	 Well I've known people who have done this before. Yeah.  You just- it's really fun actually 'cause you have like a fake engagement party and all your friends come over and like...	Ses01M-impro03-07-01-F010.wav	07
Ses04M_script03_1_M004	 I don't care, then.	Ses04M-script03-07-01-1_M004.wav	07
Ses03F_impro03_F012	 Yeah, I said yes, but I, yeah, I mean,	Ses03F-impro03-07-01-F012.wav	07
Ses01F_impro06_F021	 My best friend Heather.  She's got a- we have a- we built this like little--  There's a park, Prospect Park.  And there is like a garden section of it that we set up for her.	Ses01F-impro06-04-01-F021.wav	04
Ses03F_impro04_M016	 Well, they tip well.	Ses03F-impro04-01-01-M016.wav	01
Ses05M_script01_1b_M003	 I don't know.  But after he saw it, he ran back into the house and started crying in the kitchen.	Ses05M-script01-04-01-1b_M003.wav	04
Ses03M_impro06_M015	 and the kids are paralyzed in a coma right now.	Ses03M-impro06-04-01-M015.wav	04
Ses04F_script01_2_F009	 Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish but she's waited.	Ses04F-script01-05-01-2_F009.wav	05
Ses03M_impro06_M004	 He was my only friend growing up.	Ses03M-impro06-04-01-M004.wav	04
Ses03M_script01_3_M036	 And then I came here and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them was a kind of bus accident.	Ses03M-script01-04-01-3_M036.wav	04
Ses01F_script03_2_M016	 you going out somewhere, dear?	Ses01F-script03-01-01-2_M016.wav	01
Ses02M_impro04_F012	 So you should take that in consideration rather than giving yourself such a hard time.	Ses02M-impro04-01-01-F012.wav	01
Ses03F_impro08_F012	 Okay, well, we will send you- We will reimburse you for the amount of minutes that you-	Ses03F-impro08-01-01-F012.wav	01
Ses01M_script01_3_F003	 Not sorry, no.  I can't stay here.	Ses01M-script01-04-01-3_F003.wav	04
Ses01F_script01_3_F007	 I knew they would.	Ses01F-script01-01-01-3_F007.wav	01
Ses01F_impro02_F005	 I know.	Ses01F-impro02-04-01-F005.wav	04
Ses03M_script01_3_M004	 What?	Ses03M-script01-01-01-3_M004.wav	01
Ses03F_impro08_M021	 About three million dollars.	Ses03F-impro08-01-01-M021.wav	01
Ses02F_script03_2_F012	 Well, it's become a habit with you.	Ses02F-script03-01-01-2_F012.wav	01
Ses03M_impro05b_F000	 Can I help you sir?	Ses03M-impro05b-01-01-F000.wav	01
Ses01M_impro06_M028	 Yeah, I'm glad I was there. Glad I- glad I got to be there.	Ses01M-impro06-04-01-M028.wav	04
Ses01M_impro01_M031	 Why, because I'm sick of talking to you.	Ses01M-impro01-05-01-M031.wav	05
Ses01M_script01_1_M038	 Then help me stay here mom.	Ses01M-script01-04-01-1_M038.wav	04
Ses05M_impro08_M021	 Of course.  we seriously- Yeah, I mean, obviously you've worked- you know -- I don't want to hassle you anymore.	Ses05M-impro08-01-01-M021.wav	01
Ses05M_script03_1_F004	 It was bound to happen sooner or later.	Ses05M-script03-07-01-1_F004.wav	07
Ses01F_script03_2_M004	 You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.	Ses01F-script03-01-01-2_M004.wav	01
Ses02M_script02_2_F044	 Augie, I'm sorry.	Ses02M-script02-04-01-2_F044.wav	04
Ses02F_impro06_M017	 I know. but you're not  I mean you're not going to forget him.  The pain will go away eventually and--or it will subside--	Ses02F-impro06-01-01-M017.wav	01
Ses04M_impro07_M014	 Um, but, uh- anyway -- yeah, so that's awesome, though, because you live here and then we're not going to be separated by me going to some other school	Ses04M-impro07-07-01-M014.wav	07
Ses05M_impro01_M015	 Wouldn't you? Oh, come on.  you just tell me.  You would make an exception for me.	Ses05M-impro01-05-01-M015.wav	05
Ses05M_impro02_M012	 tell them about me and show them pictures of me and everything like that, because they are not going to see me for such a long time.  And it's such an important time and I just don't want to miss it.	Ses05M-impro02-04-01-M012.wav	04
Ses05M_script01_3_F007	 Well, from her perspective, I mean, why else would I come here?	Ses05M-script01-01-01-3_F007.wav	01
Ses03M_impro08a_M007	 I understand--we're not-	Ses03M-impro08a-01-01-M007.wav	01
Ses05M_script03_1_M014	 All the futile mortals who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them, Be flippant.  Laugh at everything, all their sacred shibboleths.	Ses05M-script03-07-01-1_M014.wav	07
Ses03M_impro08b_M004	 Oh.  I'm sorry. Um- Did you drop it in water?	Ses03M-impro08b-01-01-M004.wav	01
Ses03M_impro07_F007	 We can party.  We can have fun.	Ses03M-impro07-07-01-F007.wav	07
Ses04F_impro03_F006	 You think. [LAUGHTER]	Ses04F-impro03-07-01-F006.wav	07
Ses01F_impro02_F010	 things just aren't what they seem.	Ses01F-impro02-04-01-F010.wav	04
Ses05F_impro04_M001	 Well, of course not, but what are you going to do if you move back home?  Are you going to be able to find a job there?	Ses05F-impro04-01-01-M001.wav	01
Ses02F_script01_1_M037	 The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.	Ses02F-script01-05-01-1_M037.wav	05
Ses02F_script02_1_M021	 No. No. That's not my point.  The point is there's no point in coming down if we just leave.  Don't you want to see it?	Ses02F-script02-01-01-1_M021.wav	01
Ses01F_impro04_M025	 I am riding the bus, but by choice.	Ses01F-impro04-01-01-M025.wav	01

Ses01M_script03_1_F041	 Oh you knew there was nothing in that.	Ses01M-script03-07-01-1_F041.wav	07
Ses02M_script02_2_F021	 No.	Ses02M-script02-04-01-2_F021.wav	04
Ses03F_impro08_F001	 I [GARBAGE]	Ses03F-impro08-01-01-F001.wav	01
Ses05M_script01_1b_F034	 You don't want to think like that.	Ses05M-script01-05-01-1b_F034.wav	05
Ses02M_impro02_F006	 I hope so.	Ses02M-impro02-04-01-F006.wav	04
Ses03M_script03_2_M041	 Very amusing indeed.	Ses03M-script03-05-01-2_M041.wav	05
Ses01M_impro05_F014	 Do you have any i-?	Ses01M-impro05-01-01-F014.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_1_F030	 You're a considerate fella and there's nothing wrong in that.	Ses03F-script01-01-01-1_F030.wav	01
Ses04F_script03_2_M031	 Very good idea.  I will.	Ses04F-script03-05-01-2_M031.wav	05

Ses05F_script03_1_M030	 Oh, I didn't hit you very hard.	Ses05F-script03-01-01-1_M030.wav	01
Ses01M_script03_2_F037	 Stop it. No. Go away.	Ses01M-script03-05-01-2_F037.wav	05
Ses03F_script03_2_F039	 Stop it, stop it, I hate you, I loath you, you are overbearing and conceited and utterly impossible.	Ses03F-script03-05-01-2_F039.wav	05
Ses04F_impro04_M019	 And you like- you know, you shave your legs and everything?	Ses04F-impro04-01-01-M019.wav	01
Ses03F_impro02_F040	 I know.	Ses03F-impro02-04-01-F040.wav	04
Ses05F_impro07_M030	 Exactly.  Mooching off of all like the college experiences, that would've been me but you have saved me from that disaster. Thank you. Thank you very much.	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-M030.wav	07
Ses03F_script03_2_M017	 Going somewhere, dear?	Ses03F-script03-05-01-2_M017.wav	05

Ses01M_script02_2_M040	 Right.	Ses01M-script02-01-01-2_M040.wav	01
Ses02F_script03_1_M022	 Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow our trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as much as we can.  Like quite idiotic, very small school children.  Let's savor the delight of the moment.	Ses02F-script03-07-01-1_M022.wav	07
Ses03M_script01_1_F021	 Well, I mean, you got to make sure your dad's not going--	Ses03M-script01-01-01-1_F021.wav	01
Ses03M_script03_1_F018	 That's serious enough.	Ses03M-script03-04-01-1_F018.wav	04
Ses04F_impro04_M002	 Just, I don't know, maybe you're not smart enough.	Ses04F-impro04-01-01-M002.wav	01
Ses05M_impro04_F024	 Fair enough.	Ses05M-impro04-01-01-F024.wav	01
Ses02F_script02_1_M017	 Do you want my jacket?	Ses02F-script02-01-01-1_M017.wav	01
Ses02F_script01_3_M021	 Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going from me.	Ses02F-script01-04-01-3_M021.wav	04
Ses04M_script01_1_F028	 The trouble is, you don't see enough women.  You never did.	Ses04M-script01-01-01-1_F028.wav	01
Ses03F_impro06_F014	 Kind of a whole year. I mean, he suffered with this, this monster, this thing, this disease.	Ses03F-impro06-04-01-F014.wav	04
Ses01M_impro02_M018	 We're going to be okay.	Ses01M-impro02-04-01-M018.wav	04

Ses02M_script02_2_F015	 Do you remember the first time we came to see it? It was about four years ago right after we got married.	Ses02M-script02-04-01-2_F015.wav	04
Ses01M_impro03_F012	 Like make her rent the apartment that you two have to live together in, you know. And you won't pay any rent or you pay like, a hundred bucks a month or something.	Ses01M-impro03-07-01-F012.wav	07
Ses01F_impro03_M009	 Does that mean that you're going to get citizenship, too, in- in England or whatever?	Ses01F-impro03-01-01-M009.wav	01
Ses02M_impro03_F001	 Finally did what?	Ses02M-impro03-07-01-F001.wav	07
Ses04M_impro03_M015	 Barefoot?	Ses04M-impro03-07-01-M015.wav	07
Ses01F_script03_2_F037	 Oh shut up.  Let go.  I hate you, I hate you.  Do you hear?  You are a conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible.	Ses01F-script03-05-01-2_F037.wav	05
Ses01F_script01_2_F011	 I won't stand for any nonsense.	Ses01F-script01-05-01-2_F011.wav	05
Ses03M_impro02_F024	 A whole year? --We're not talking about like a couple months here.  I mean this is a whole year.	Ses03M-impro02-04-01-F024.wav	04
Ses01F_impro07_M012	 Is this a Masters or a P.h.D.?  Or can you...? Nice	Ses01F-impro07-01-01-M012.wav	01
Ses01M_script01_1_F024	 From father's point of view he is not dead and you have no right to take his girl.  I'm just saying that you can go on from there if you know where to go but I'm saying I don't know where to go.  See, I don't know.	Ses01M-script01-05-01-1_F024.wav	05
Ses01M_script02_1_M009	 Oh, well, yeah of course.	Ses01M-script02-01-01-1_M009.wav	01
Ses01F_impro02_F020	 And I want lots and lots and lots of pictures.	Ses01F-impro02-04-01-F020.wav	04

Ses04F_script02_2_F009	 For heaven's sake, grow up we are not going to see the Grunions.	Ses04F-script02-05-01-2_F009.wav	05
Ses04M_script01_2_M019	 What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you, Kate?	Ses04M-script01-05-01-2_M019.wav	05
Ses02M_script02_1_M005	 Although, I guess you can't tell it probably isn't them. Probably be unmistakable don't you think?	Ses02M-script02-07-01-1_M005.wav	07
Ses05M_impro04_F019	 I understand.	Ses05M-impro04-01-01-F019.wav	01
Ses03M_script01_2_M004	 Who said he even thought about that?	Ses03M-script01-01-01-2_M004.wav	01
Ses01F_impro06_M015	 Mmhmm.	Ses01F-impro06-01-01-M015.wav	01

Ses02F_impro04_M007	 ...dumber than you.  I mean they're a lot worse off than you.  You are much better off than like a lot of those people in there. I know	Ses02F-impro04-01-01-M007.wav	01
Ses02M_impro05_F009	 Okay	Ses02M-impro05-01-01-F009.wav	01
Ses05F_impro07_M020	 [garbage] I know, I know, I know, we'll figure it out.  Right?  [garbage] it is going to be so much fun.	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-M020.wav	07
Ses02M_script02_1_M000	 What time is it? They're supposed to run around midnight.	Ses02M-script02-07-01-1_M000.wav	07
Ses05M_impro06_M001	 My friend, Shotty, passed away.	Ses05M-impro06-04-01-M001.wav	04
Ses04M_impro05_M014	 No, no, because, look, I don't care what your policy says.  I mean--	Ses04M-impro05-05-01-M014.wav	05
Ses03F_script03_2_M011	 I'll have a little, I think.	Ses03F-script03-01-01-2_M011.wav	01

Ses05F_script03_1_M016	 No, that fire will fade along with our passion.	Ses05F-script03-07-01-1_M016.wav	07
Ses04F_script03_2_F012	 It's become a habit with you.	Ses04F-script03-05-01-2_F012.wav	05
Ses01M_script02_1_M046	 It's crazy.  Look at this, I'm giving myself goose bumps, the hairs are standing up on my arm.	Ses01M-script02-07-01-1_M046.wav	07
Ses04F_script03_2_M008	 That's a nice point of view, I must say.	Ses04F-script03-05-01-2_M008.wav	05
Ses02F_impro08_F002	 I completely understand.  Automated systems are very difficult sometimes.	Ses02F-impro08-01-01-F002.wav	01
Ses04F_impro03_M020	 I just think browns are really what you want to go with.  I mean I think there's more contrast between brown and green than there is-	Ses04F-impro03-01-01-M020.wav	01
Ses05M_impro04_M020	 Let me know that's -- that's fine.  You think I have an abrasive vibe, whatever.  You're entitled to your opinion, of course.  Maybe that's why I don't have a job.	Ses05M-impro04-05-01-M020.wav	05
Ses01M_script01_3_F006	 You've been kind of embarrassed ever since I got here.	Ses01M-script01-04-01-3_F006.wav	04
Ses04M_script03_2_F031	 You're quite insufferable.  I expected it's because you're drunk.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_F031.wav	05
Ses03F_script03_1_M007	 things that should matter dreadfully don't seem to matter at all when one's happy, do they?	Ses03F-script03-07-01-1_M007.wav	07
Ses02F_impro07_F016	 I don't mind worrying about all the paperwork.  You know--	Ses02F-impro07-07-01-F016.wav	07

Ses02F_impro07_F023	 So, um, so I don't know.	Ses02F-impro07-07-01-F023.wav	07
Ses02M_script02_1_M040	 It's single mindedness, with no mind, it's urgency that's pure urge, they don't know what drives them. They don't ask it a name or ask it a question,	Ses02M-script02-07-01-1_M040.wav	07
Ses04F_impro06_F001	 You know it's just, I just, you know, I mean it just happened.  I just, like- I just keep expecting him to walk in, you know.	Ses04F-impro06-04-01-F001.wav	04
Ses02F_script01_2_M002	 What do you mean?  He lived next door to the girl all his life.  Why wouldn't he want to see her again?	Ses02F-script01-01-01-2_M002.wav	01
Ses01F_impro05_F017	 I don't care what you're freaking sign says.  Somebody- Somebody needs to replace everything I've got there and give me money for my inconvenience.	Ses01F-impro05-05-01-F017.wav	05
Ses03M_impro08a_M013	 So you could----speak with me some more, you could call back later on maybe.	Ses03M-impro08a-01-01-M013.wav	01
Ses05F_impro02_M029	 I understand.  I'm worried about you.  I don't know what's going to happen to you.	Ses05F-impro02-04-01-M029.wav	04
Ses01M_impro06_F028	 Are there things you wish you'd done differently?	Ses01M-impro06-01-01-F028.wav	01
Ses03M_script01_3_F008	 Well, I don't know, embarrassed of her since I came.	Ses03M-script01-04-01-3_F008.wav	04

Ses01F_impro04_M026	 To save the environment, carpool.	Ses01F-impro04-01-01-M026.wav	01
Ses03M_impro03_M038	 I'm still working at my parents' restaurant. Busing tables.	Ses03M-impro03-01-01-M038.wav	01
Ses01M_impro01_F007	 No, I need your ID to give you a second ID.	Ses01M-impro01-05-01-F007.wav	05
Ses02M_script02_1_F006	 I'm cold.	Ses02M-script02-01-01-1_F006.wav	01
Ses03M_impro01_M011	 I'm not going anywhere.  I'm staying right here.	Ses03M-impro01-05-01-M011.wav	05
Ses03F_script03_2_F014	 Don't be so stupid.	Ses03F-script03-05-01-2_F014.wav	05
Ses02M_impro06_F004	 It's going to be so rough, I'm sorry.	Ses02M-impro06-04-01-F004.wav	04

Ses03F_impro06_M002	 I didn't know him, Tricia, but uh- I heard that he was a great man.	Ses03F-impro06-04-01-M002.wav	04
Ses04M_script03_2_M013	 That's a nice point of view, I must say.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M013.wav	05
Ses01M_script01_1_M017	 I'm going to ask her to marry me.	Ses01M-script01-01-01-1_M017.wav	01
Ses01M_script01_3_F008	 From her point of view why else would I come?	Ses01M-script01-01-01-3_F008.wav	01
Ses01F_script03_2_M029	 Look, you better turn that off. I don't want to wake up the people upstairs.	Ses01F-script03-05-01-2_M029.wav	05
Ses05M_impro03_M020	 Of course.  We'll go out to dinner later this week.	Ses05M-impro03-07-01-M020.wav	07
Ses05M_impro08_M022	 I completely understand.	Ses05M-impro08-01-01-M022.wav	01
Ses05F_script03_2_M022	 They snap.	Ses05F-script03-05-01-2_M022.wav	05
Ses05F_impro06_M003	 I am so sorry,  It's-	Ses05F-impro06-04-01-M003.wav	04
Ses04M_script01_1_F027	 How do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way father does.	Ses04M-script01-01-01-1_F027.wav	01
Ses05M_script03_2_F005	 Well, what of it.	Ses05M-script03-01-01-2_F005.wav	01
Ses01M_script03_2_M040	 You...You're an evil minded, self-centered little wench and I never want to see you again.	Ses01M-script03-05-01-2_M040.wav	05
Ses05M_impro06_F004	 What did he do?	Ses05M-impro06-04-01-F004.wav	04
Ses04M_script01_2_F000	 Why did he invite her here?	Ses04M-script01-05-01-2_F000.wav	05
Ses04F_script02_1_M009	 I hope the moon stays out.  I wonder do they always run during a full moon.  I can't remember if it was full last year.  Remember?	Ses04F-script02-07-01-1_M009.wav	07
Ses01M_script03_2_M036	 Turn it off. It's driving me mad.	Ses01M-script03-05-01-2_M036.wav	05

Ses05F_impro07_F035	 We should go apartment shop-er-hunting.	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-F035.wav	07
Ses05F_script03_1_M013	 All the futile mortals who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.  Laugh at everything, all their sacred shibboleths.  Flippancy brings out the acid in their damned sweetness and light.	Ses05F-script03-07-01-1_M013.wav	07
Ses03M_script01_1_F028	 Did you ask Annie yet?	Ses03M-script01-01-01-1_F028.wav	01
Ses03M_script01_3_F031	 And you still feel that way?	Ses03M-script01-04-01-3_F031.wav	04
Ses05F_impro02_F001	 um.	Ses05F-impro02-04-01-F001.wav	04
Ses02M_impro08_M022	 Yeah, yeah. Maybe we'll, uh-	Ses02M-impro08-01-01-M022.wav	01
Ses02F_script02_1_M041	 They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them right here to where we stand, for a massive celebration of sex and death.	Ses02F-script02-07-01-1_M041.wav	07
Ses03M_impro03_F004	 Are you serious [GARBAGE] man?	Ses03M-impro03-07-01-F004.wav	07

Ses01M_impro03_M021	 And then we can honeymoon.  I want to go tropical though like Bahamas- --or like Tahiti or something. I just want to like beach and like drink.	Ses01M-impro03-01-01-M021.wav	01
Ses01M_script02_2_F047	 Or not.	Ses01M-script02-01-01-2_F047.wav	01

Ses04M_impro03_F008	 Yeah, I would love to. Thanks. [LAUGHTER]	Ses04M-impro03-07-01-F008.wav	07
Ses01F_impro02_F015	 Last month--  Yeah.	Ses01F-impro02-04-01-F015.wav	04
Ses01F_script03_2_M022	 Nonsense.  They have a bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap. They snap.	Ses01F-script03-05-01-2_M022.wav	05
Ses03F_impro02_F011	 It's going- It's going to be probably in about three weeks.	Ses03F-impro02-04-01-F011.wav	04
Ses03F_script01_2_M004	 Well, so what?	Ses03F-script01-01-01-2_M004.wav	01
Ses03M_script02_1_M042	 [BREATHING] So what do you think?	Ses03M-script02-07-01-1_M042.wav	07
Ses01M_impro07_F014	 Okay. That would be way too much of a commute you can't do that. Especially- I know especially from--I don't know, what I was going to say, I don't know.	Ses01M-impro07-07-01-F014.wav	07
Ses02M_script01_3_M035	 Otherwise all you have is really loot and there's blood on it.  And I didn't want to take any of that.  And I guess that included you.	Ses02M-script01-04-01-3_M035.wav	04
Ses02F_impro04_M005	 No.  It's--I mean, it's competitive, you know.  That's-That's what it is.  that's what you gotta be is competitive.	Ses02F-impro04-01-01-M005.wav	01
Ses05F_impro05_M018	 Well, you know, sometimes that's--really, I mean what else could we do?	Ses05F-impro05-01-01-M018.wav	01
Ses05M_script02_1_M031	 And it's single mindedness with no mind. It- It's urgency, it's pure urge.  I mean, they didn't make any decisions.  They don't ask any questions.  They don't give it a name,	Ses05M-script02-07-01-1_M031.wav	07
Ses05M_script03_2_F004	 Oh, maybe a little.  Nothing serious.	Ses05M-script03-01-01-2_F004.wav	01
Ses02F_script01_3_M027	 For instance, one time, it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks.  I put them in pocket.  It's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had.	Ses02F-script01-04-01-3_M027.wav	04
Ses04F_impro04_F025	 Well you- just you're doing something wrong.	Ses04F-impro04-05-01-F025.wav	05
Ses03M_impro02_M013	 We'll have internet set up, we'll get web cameras and everything.  My whole family's here too.	Ses03M-impro02-01-01-M013.wav	01
Ses05F_impro07_F028	 [LAUGHTER] Oh, it'll be awesome, that's for sure.	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-F028.wav	07
Ses04F_script01_1_F013	 How are you going to prove it?  Can you prove it?	Ses04F-script01-05-01-1_F013.wav	05
Ses05M_script03_2_F026	 You always had a weak head.	Ses05M-script03-01-01-2_F026.wav	01
Ses05M_script02_2_F014	 And I remember thinking to myself, finally.  I am as happy as I am supposed to be.	Ses05M-script02-04-01-2_F014.wav	04
Ses05F_script03_1_M028	 The worst one was in Cannes when your curling irons burnt a hole in my new dressing gown.	Ses05F-script03-07-01-1_M028.wav	07
Ses05M_impro01_F000	 Can I help you?	Ses05M-impro01-01-01-F000.wav	01
Ses01M_script01_1_F042	 I don't understand you, do I?	Ses01M-script01-05-01-1_F042.wav	05
Ses05F_impro07_F029	 Better than if I'd picked up and moved to Boston.	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-F029.wav	07
Ses04F_impro02_M004	 And, uh, I'm afraid that if you, you know, when you leave, you won't come back.	Ses04F-impro02-04-01-M004.wav	04
Ses05M_script03_2_M028	 I do believe that I have said already that I had three minuet liquor glasses of brandy in the entire evening.  A child of two couldn't get drunk of that.	Ses05M-script03-05-01-2_M028.wav	05
Ses01M_impro06_F010	 Oh. Really fast? Oh.	Ses01M-impro06-01-01-F010.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_2_M015	 Why me above all?	Ses03F-script01-05-01-2_M015.wav	05
Ses05F_impro05_F024	 That's all you can offer me? I mean, my the stuff in there is worth way more than fifty dollar.	Ses05F-impro05-05-01-F024.wav	05
Ses01M_impro03_F016	 Oh I don't know. [LAUGHTER]	Ses01M-impro03-07-01-F016.wav	07

Ses05F_impro03_F001	 I'm getting married.	Ses05F-impro03-07-01-F001.wav	07
Ses05M_script02_2_F001	 It's ridiculous.	Ses05M-script02-01-01-2_F001.wav	01
Ses01F_impro05_M015	 No, no.  This is real.	Ses01F-impro05-01-01-M015.wav	01
Ses03M_impro02_F016	 I can't do this.	Ses03M-impro02-04-01-F016.wav	04
Ses03M_script02_1_M036	 I mean, think about this, I know you're not interested but just think about this for a minute.	Ses03M-script02-07-01-1_M036.wav	07
Ses02M_impro02_M009	 I've never been - I've never been away from you for two weeks let alone a year.	Ses02M-impro02-04-01-M009.wav	04

Ses02M_impro03_F020	 Ooh, that would be fun.	Ses02M-impro03-07-01-F020.wav	07
Ses01F_impro01_F000	 Excuse me.	Ses01F-impro01-01-01-F000.wav	01
Ses03M_impro08b_F006	 No I did not drop my phone in water.  I'm not five years old and just dropped my phone anywhere I see it.  Okay this is my business.	Ses03M-impro08b-05-01-F006.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_1_M012	 You mustn't be serious, my dear.  That's just what they want.	Ses04M-script03-01-01-1_M012.wav	01
Ses02F_script02_1_M003	 How you doing?	Ses02F-script02-07-01-1_M003.wav	07

Ses05F_impro02_M010	 Where do you have to go?  Where are you going?	Ses05F-impro02-05-01-M010.wav	05
Ses02M_impro04_F006	 Well, I mean you're still here you've tried for this long so I think that says something all in itself.	Ses02M-impro04-01-01-F006.wav	01
Ses05F_impro07_M002	 Oh, sweet.	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-M002.wav	07
Ses03M_impro03_F001	 What?	Ses03M-impro03-07-01-F001.wav	07
Ses04F_script02_1_M038	 They don't know what drives them.  They don't give it a name or ask question.  They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them here to this place	Ses04F-script02-07-01-1_M038.wav	07
Ses03M_script01_1_M019	 I want to ask her to marry me.	Ses03M-script01-01-01-1_M019.wav	01

Ses03M_impro06_F005	 I'm so sorry.	Ses03M-impro06-04-01-F005.wav	04
Ses04F_script01_1_F030	 Well that's a good answer but it don't answer anything.  You haven't seen her since you went to war.  It's been five years.	Ses04F-script01-05-01-1_F030.wav	05
Ses02M_script03_2_M042	 You're a vile tempered, loose living, wicked little beast and I hope I never see you again as long as I live.	Ses02M-script03-05-01-2_M042.wav	05
Ses05F_impro05_F006	 That's good.	Ses05F-impro05-01-01-F006.wav	01
Ses02F_script03_1_M008	 Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy.  Do they?	Ses02F-script03-01-01-1_M008.wav	01
Ses03F_impro08_F029	 Okay? Thank you for calling.  Goodbye.	Ses03F-impro08-01-01-F029.wav	01

Ses05F_script02_2_F005	 God damn it, Augie.  Why do you always ask things like that?  It's so insulting.	Ses05F-script02-05-01-2_F005.wav	05
Ses03F_script03_2_M012	 No particular reason. Anyhow, they were very small ones.	Ses03F-script03-01-01-2_M012.wav	01
Ses04F_script02_2_F002	 It's PR.  Somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is going to take place on the beach.	Ses04F-script02-05-01-2_F002.wav	05
Ses04F_script01_3_F023	 Yeah, sure.	Ses04F-script01-01-01-3_F023.wav	01

Ses04F_impro04_M013	 I mean, well I mean i don't know; it doesn't really affect my life, you know.	Ses04F-impro04-01-01-M013.wav	01
Ses02M_impro01_F002	 do you have two forms of ID with you?	Ses02M-impro01-01-01-F002.wav	01
Ses01M_impro06_M017	 So weird you know that like one days it's like you know sounds so stupid but like one day someone's here. And like next day you know they're not here and it just kind of makes you like think about like life and mortality and like that kind of stuff.  You just like used to take for granted--you know.	Ses01M-impro06-04-01-M017.wav	04
Ses01M_impro03_M019	 What should we do?  Where should we get married? We should have party.	Ses01M-impro03-07-01-M019.wav	07
Ses03M_impro08a_M009	 We can give you a new phone--	Ses03M-impro08a-01-01-M009.wav	01

Ses02M_script03_1_M016	 No, that desire will fade along with our passion.	Ses02M-script03-04-01-1_M016.wav	04
Ses03M_script02_2_F011	 Augie, god dammit, don't ask me that.  You always ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  It's insulting.	Ses03M-script02-05-01-2_F011.wav	05
Ses01F_script01_3_M036	 And I didn't want any of it. I guess that included you.	Ses01F-script01-04-01-3_M036.wav	04
Ses01F_impro02_M001	 I don't understand.  You've already done so much, I don't know why do you have to go back.	Ses01F-impro02-04-01-M001.wav	04
Ses01F_impro07_M015	 You have to get married.  Well you are married to Chuck.  You're Mrs. Nash.  Not to be confused with Mrs. Dash which is the popular seasoning.	Ses01F-impro07-07-01-M015.wav	07
Ses01M_script01_1_M035	 Yes, yes I like it for one hour a day.  I don't care if I have to grub for money all day long when I come home I want it nice, I want a family, I want to kids and Annie is in the center of that.	Ses01M-script01-05-01-1_M035.wav	05
Ses03F_script01_3_F033	 Because you can't feel that way, never again, Chris. You hear me? Never. I mean, the money and me too.	Ses03F-script01-04-01-3_F033.wav	04

Ses04M_script01_2_F013	 Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.	Ses04M-script01-05-01-2_F013.wav	05
Ses03F_script03_2_F038	 Listen, indeed. No, no, no, no. I am sick and tired of listening to you, you sadistic bully.	Ses03F-script03-05-01-2_F038.wav	05
Ses05M_script01_1_M020	 Oh, so it isn't just my business?	Ses05M-script01-05-01-1_M020.wav	05
Ses04F_script03_2_F041	 finally and forever	Ses04F-script03-05-01-2_F041.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_M040	 Very good idea.  I will	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M040.wav	05
Ses05M_impro08_M023	 Absolutely. And I just don't want that to happen to you anymore.	Ses05M-impro08-01-01-M023.wav	01
Ses04M_script01_1_F034	 What the hell is this?	Ses04M-script01-05-01-1_F034.wav	05
Ses04M_impro06_M016	 I hope it rains.  Somehow that'll make me feel more comfortable.	Ses04M-impro06-04-01-M016.wav	04
Ses05F_script01_1_M002	 Around Four this morning, and there was a crack and I looked out.  We're standing right there when I cracked.	Ses05F-script01-04-01-1_M002.wav	04
Ses04M_impro08_M008	 So you're saying that you didn't make these calls.	Ses04M-impro08-01-01-M008.wav	01

Ses03M_script03_2_M003	 You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.	Ses03M-script03-05-01-2_M003.wav	05
Ses05F_script03_2_F012	 It's becoming a habit with you.	Ses05F-script03-01-01-2_F012.wav	01
Ses04M_impro08_M006	 I am seeing the two hundred dollar charge.	Ses04M-impro08-01-01-M006.wav	01
Ses04F_script03_2_M014	 Really, Amanda.	Ses04F-script03-05-01-2_M014.wav	05
Ses04M_script02_1_M029	 Out there someplace is this huge mass of silver fish heading this way.  They don't know why.  We don't know why.  It wasn't a decision.  They didn't take a vote.  No one sent them an invitation or a map;	Ses04M-script02-07-01-1_M029.wav	07
Ses04F_script01_1_F011	 What do you want to do, argue with him?	Ses04F-script01-05-01-1_F011.wav	05
Ses02F_script01_3_M023	 It's all mixed up with so many other things.  You remember overseas, I was in command of a company?	Ses02F-script01-04-01-3_M023.wav	04
Ses05M_impro07_F017	 Good tradeoff	Ses05M-impro07-01-01-F017.wav	01

Ses03M_impro07_F016	 Man I'm just so happy for you.  I just--	Ses03M-impro07-07-01-F016.wav	07

Ses01F_impro04_F001	 I don't know.  Isn't that-- that's all like escort services and things like that.	Ses01F-impro04-01-01-F001.wav	01
Ses04M_script01_2_F008	 She's not his girl, Joe.  She knows she's not.	Ses04M-script01-05-01-2_F008.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_1_F024	 I know you did.  You threw it out of the window into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.	Ses04M-script03-07-01-1_F024.wav	07
Ses01M_script02_2_F022	 And I remember thinking this is it. finally, finally I'm as happy as I'm supposed to be.	Ses01M-script02-04-01-2_F022.wav	04
Ses01M_impro06_F009	 Well, I'm confused.  He was sick or it was an accident?	Ses01M-impro06-01-01-F009.wav	01
Ses01M_impro06_F022	 MMhmm.	Ses01M-impro06-01-01-F022.wav	01

Ses03F_impro02_F020	 Babe, I'm sorry. But I don't want to do.	Ses03F-impro02-04-01-F020.wav	04
Ses02F_impro03_M016	 Uh, huh. I mean, you know, it's spring--It'll be--	Ses02F-impro03-01-01-M016.wav	01
Ses04F_impro07_F032	 That is why I got accepted.	Ses04F-impro07-07-01-F032.wav	07
Ses04M_impro06_F001	 I'm sorry.	Ses04M-impro06-04-01-F001.wav	04
Ses04M_script03_2_F000	 That was the first time you ever hit me.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_F000.wav	05
Ses01F_impro07_M002	 Oh my God. What are you going to do? [LAUGHTER]	Ses01F-impro07-07-01-M002.wav	07
Ses05F_impro07_M014	 Oh, I bet you're going to love it too.  You always wanted to go to U.S.C..	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-M014.wav	07
Ses04M_impro05_F019	 I understand that.  I would know if it was mine. Um-	Ses04M-impro05-01-01-F019.wav	01
Ses01F_impro04_M003	 Uh huh.	Ses01F-impro04-01-01-M003.wav	01
Ses02F_impro07_F013	 Like it has some prestige. so	Ses02F-impro07-07-01-F013.wav	07
Ses04F_script02_1_M037	 It's single mindedness with no mind.  Urgency that's pure urge.	Ses04F-script02-07-01-1_M037.wav	07
Ses04F_impro07_M045	 Yeah, you want to go.  No, you want to go. You want to go.	Ses04F-impro07-07-01-M045.wav	07

Ses01M_script03_2_F017	 Well it's a woman's duty to allure the man. Watch me a minute will you?	Ses01M-script03-05-01-2_F017.wav	05
Ses02F_script03_1_M007	 With the most perfect poise?	Ses02F-script03-01-01-1_M007.wav	01
Ses05M_impro08_M015	 And hit enter.	Ses05M-impro08-01-01-M015.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_3_M041	 Otherwise, what you have here is loot; and there's blood on it.	Ses03F-script01-04-01-3_M041.wav	04
Ses05F_script01_1_F000	 What's he going to say? Maybe we should tell him before he sees it.	Ses05F-script01-04-01-1_F000.wav	04
Ses04M_impro03_M023	 Thank you.  I'm really -- I'm really excited.  And it's -- I don't know, it's like a little -- it's like a little scary, 'cause I'm like, ah, you know, it's the first time I've ever done anything like this.	Ses04M-impro03-07-01-M023.wav	07
Ses02M_impro05_F005	 Well, sometimes it's just late baggage or misplaced baggage and it comes out but it seems to be here and just I'm reading off of this that	Ses02M-impro05-01-01-F005.wav	01
Ses01M_impro04_F012	 No.	Ses01M-impro04-01-01-F012.wav	01

Ses04M_impro04_F009	 I mean, I'm not saying that you should, you know--	Ses04M-impro04-01-01-F009.wav	01
Ses04F_script03_1_M030	 How long did that row last?	Ses04F-script03-01-01-1_M030.wav	01
Ses02M_script03_2_M031	 We can get a good little debate going about that, don't you think? Intemperate tots.	Ses02M-script03-05-01-2_M031.wav	05
Ses04M_script01_1_F017	 Well that's only your business, Chris.	Ses04M-script01-01-01-1_F017.wav	01

Ses01M_script01_2_M015	 What does that mean? Me above all? What does that mean?	Ses01M-script01-05-01-2_M015.wav	05
Ses03F_script01_3_F026	 Well then tell me what's wrong. I mean, even in your letters there's something ashamed.	Ses03F-script01-04-01-3_F026.wav	04
Ses04M_script01_1_F015	 Why?	Ses04M-script01-01-01-1_F015.wav	01
Ses05M_impro07_M033	 Really?	Ses05M-impro07-07-01-M033.wav	07

Ses03M_impro02_M027	 I know.  I know.  But they really need some good guys there.	Ses03M-impro02-04-01-M027.wav	04
Ses03M_impro02_M003	 they need me out there sooner than I thought	Ses03M-impro02-04-01-M003.wav	04
Ses03M_script03_2_F033	 Not very funny dear.  In fact, maybe you better have some more brandy.	Ses03M-script03-05-01-2_F033.wav	05
Ses01M_impro06_M020	 What?	Ses01M-impro06-04-01-M020.wav	04

Ses05F_script01_1_M009	 You know that Larry's not coming back, and I know it.  So why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him?	Ses05F-script01-04-01-1_M009.wav	04
Ses03M_impro05a_F014	 Yes--it is	Ses03M-impro05a-01-01-F014.wav	01
Ses03M_script03_2_M034	 You better turn that off.	Ses03M-script03-05-01-2_M034.wav	05
Ses03M_impro08a_M023	 Well I'm sure maybe there's a phone at work you could use.	Ses03M-impro08a-01-01-M023.wav	01
Ses02F_impro03_F013	 I was just--it was so like I thought this might happen eventually, but like not yet, you know what I mean?  Like--	Ses02F-impro03-07-01-F013.wav	07
Ses05F_impro07_F033	 [LAUGHTER]	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-F033.wav	07

Ses02M_script03_2_F000	 You knew there was nothing in that.	Ses02M-script03-07-01-2_F000.wav	07
Ses01F_impro04_F013	 I just- I mean I call people up and I tell them what I'm good at.	Ses01F-impro04-01-01-F013.wav	01
Ses02F_script01_1_M029	 Because it is.	Ses02F-script01-01-01-1_M029.wav	01
Ses03F_impro06_F002	 Mmm hmm. I never knew it was going to be this hard, you know.	Ses03F-impro06-04-01-F002.wav	04
Ses01M_impro03_F026	 Oh, totally. Yeah.	Ses01M-impro03-07-01-F026.wav	07
Ses02M_impro01_M019	 What web- I didn't go to a website - why would I need to - it's the D.M.V.. You come to the D.M.V., you wait in line for three hours, and then you go home.	Ses02M-impro01-05-01-M019.wav	05
Ses05F_impro05_F021	 Yeah, meaning I didn't die in a fiery plane crash.  How convenient, but um- I paid two thousand dollar to ride your airline, and I would really appreciate getting my bags there to my destination in one place.	Ses05F-impro05-05-01-F021.wav	05
Ses02F_script03_2_F042	 I am.  Let go of me.  You're a cruel fiend and I hate and loathe you.	Ses02F-script03-05-01-2_F042.wav	05

Ses01M_script01_2_F000	 Why did he invite her here?	Ses01M-script01-05-01-2_F000.wav	05
Ses05F_script03_2_F011	 Well, it seems silly to go on and on in such a thing.	Ses05F-script03-01-01-2_F011.wav	01
Ses05F_impro08_F005	 Uh- when's when's-	Ses05F-impro08-01-01-F005.wav	01
Ses03M_impro03_M003	 This guy. Yeah.  Can you believe it? She said yes too. Yeah.  She said yes.	Ses03M-impro03-07-01-M003.wav	07
Ses03M_impro08a_M005	 So what exactly is the problem?	Ses03M-impro08a-01-01-M005.wav	01
Ses03M_impro06_M014	 The mother and father died--	Ses03M-impro06-04-01-M014.wav	04
Ses05M_impro08_F007	 Hmm. Mmm.	Ses05M-impro08-01-01-F007.wav	01
Ses03M_script02_2_F033	 Cause everything isn't anything like I thought it would be.	Ses03M-script02-05-01-2_F033.wav	05
Ses01M_script01_1_M004	 No.  I figured I'd just let it wait.	Ses01M-script01-04-01-1_M004.wav	04
Ses05F_impro07_F005	 I'll stay in town.	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-F005.wav	07
Ses05M_impro04_F014	 Right.  Maybe you have, like, you know a little bit of an abrasive vibe or something.	Ses05M-impro04-01-01-F014.wav	01
Ses03M_impro05a_F007	 You're at me and I'm going to try to help you out sir but you just have to cooperate with me--	Ses03M-impro05a-01-01-F007.wav	01
Ses01F_impro01_F002	 Is there a problem?	Ses01F-impro01-01-01-F002.wav	01
Ses04M_script03_1_F015	 Shall we always want to bicker and fight?	Ses04M-script03-07-01-1_F015.wav	07
Ses01M_script02_1_M000	 What time is it?  God, this is great, isn't it?  I can't believe it.	Ses01M-script02-07-01-1_M000.wav	07
Ses02F_script01_1_F036	 Are you crazy?	Ses02F-script01-05-01-1_F036.wav	05
Ses01F_impro06_M014	 Mmhmm.	Ses01F-impro06-01-01-M014.wav	01
Ses04F_script02_1_M026	 like the swallows returning to Capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs, like that.  There's mystery here and magic	Ses04F-script02-07-01-1_M026.wav	07
Ses03M_script03_1_M006	 No, wrong number.	Ses03M-script03-07-01-1_M006.wav	07
Ses04F_impro07_F063	 Social life.  Hello.	Ses04F-impro07-07-01-F063.wav	07
Ses02M_impro02_F007	 It's going to be really rough.	Ses02M-impro02-04-01-F007.wav	04
Ses03F_impro06_F003	 It's weird 'cause it's like you expected it to happen and eventually-	Ses03F-impro06-04-01-F003.wav	04
Ses04M_script03_1_F007	 Certainly.  I shall probably do a court curtsey.	Ses04M-script03-07-01-1_F007.wav	07
Ses02M_impro02_F012	 Will you write me letters, paper ones?	Ses02M-impro02-04-01-F012.wav	04
Ses01F_script01_1_M015	 I'm going to ask her to marry me.	Ses01F-script01-01-01-1_M015.wav	01
Ses05F_impro05_M009	 Well, as I told you, it left Heath Row and it seems to have arrived here.  But if you can't find it, then-are you sure you know what your bag looks like?	Ses05F-impro05-01-01-M009.wav	01
Ses05M_impro03_F003	 Oh, what, how- where how did you do it?	Ses05M-impro03-07-01-F003.wav	07
Ses05M_script02_1_M030	 somewhere out there is a giant mass of silver fish all swimming in this direction.  They don't know why they're doing it.  We don't know why they're doing it.  They didn't- It wasn't a decision.  No one took a vote.  Nobody sent them an invitation or a map or anything like that.  It was just some internal time release fire cracker that went off. And all as one they turned around and formed this giant line as long as the California coastline and they just started swimming.  They are swimming right now at this very moment.   And And-	Ses05M-script02-07-01-1_M030.wav	07
Ses05F_script02_2_F029	 I didn't say that.	Ses05F-script02-04-01-2_F029.wav	04
Ses05F_script03_1_M000	 Good God.	Ses05F-script03-07-01-1_M000.wav	07
Ses03F_impro04_M006	 we're just pooling our funds together.	Ses03F-impro04-01-01-M006.wav	01
Ses01M_script02_1_F014	 Then let's go.	Ses01M-script02-05-01-1_F014.wav	05
Ses03M_impro08a_M006	 Um- I think part of it has to do with the network being down.  It's been having some trouble the last few weeks--	Ses03M-impro08a-01-01-M006.wav	01
Ses05F_impro08_F018	 Well you know sometimes-- just with online transactions, things happens. so um-	Ses05F-impro08-01-01-F018.wav	01
Ses01F_impro06_F014	 At the cemetery?	Ses01F-impro06-04-01-F014.wav	04
Ses04F_script03_2_F040	 This is the end do you understand?  The end,	Ses04F-script03-05-01-2_F040.wav	05
Ses02F_impro08_M013	 Um- You know, window is nice. I guess	Ses02F-impro08-01-01-M013.wav	01
Ses05M_script01_1b_M004	 No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone.	Ses05M-script01-04-01-1b_M004.wav	04
Ses04F_impro03_F040	 Ha ha ha.	Ses04F-impro03-07-01-F040.wav	07
Ses03M_script03_2_F010	 I don't know why you want it.  You've already had two glasses.	Ses03M-script03-05-01-2_F010.wav	05
Ses05M_impro06_M000	 I just got some bad news.	Ses05M-impro06-04-01-M000.wav	04
Ses04M_script02_2_F007	 We just have different ideas about what this evening is supposed to look like.	Ses04M-script02-05-01-2_F007.wav	05
Ses04M_impro06_M013	 there should just be some sort of rule that people don't die until they're older, 'cause then, at least, it's expected.	Ses04M-impro06-04-01-M013.wav	04
Ses02F_impro08_M003	 Okay.	Ses02F-impro08-01-01-M003.wav	01
Ses04M_impro01_F018	 So go get in the other line or leave.  Or I will have you escorted out by security.	Ses04M-impro01-05-01-F018.wav	05
Ses01F_script01_3_F009	 I, umm. I guess, I guess that's kind of why I came.	Ses01F-script01-01-01-3_F009.wav	01
Ses04F_impro04_M001	 Well I guess you're not trying hard enough.	Ses04F-impro04-01-01-M001.wav	01
Ses04F_impro03_M041	 I'm so- all the blood	Ses04F-impro03-07-01-M041.wav	07
Ses01M_impro04_F009	 But I mean you kind of got to, you got to fake it 'til you feel it, right?	Ses01M-impro04-01-01-F009.wav	01
Ses01M_script02_2_F035	 I know that Augie, I really do.	Ses01M-script02-04-01-2_F035.wav	04
Ses05M_impro07_F011	 Uh huh.  Yes, seriously, for years.	Ses05M-impro07-07-01-F011.wav	07
Ses05F_script02_1_M029	 Look there, what's that?  Is it?  Is that a--Ah, it's a seaweed isn't it?	Ses05F-script02-07-01-1_M029.wav	07
Ses03F_script01_1_M016	 You know-you know why I asked Annie here, right?	Ses03F-script01-01-01-1_M016.wav	01
Ses05F_impro04_F038	 Well, I'd like to be a working actor.	Ses05F-impro04-01-01-F038.wav	01
Ses02F_impro03_F024	 Oh, you will--You'll find just the right girl.  And she'll be perfect for you and everything will be great.	Ses02F-impro03-07-01-F024.wav	07
Ses02M_impro08_M027	 And you know just I mean be careful in the future if um	Ses02M-impro08-01-01-M027.wav	01
Ses05F_impro04_M026	 But you have to keep trying.  You can't give up.	Ses05F-impro04-01-01-M026.wav	01
Ses01M_impro03_M022	 I'll make her pay for that.  I hear she's like totally wealthy. She's like royalty- --or something like and- --whatever like removed or something but yeah.	Ses01M-impro03-07-01-M022.wav	07
Ses02F_script01_3_M025	 Just about all.	Ses02F-script01-04-01-3_M025.wav	04
Ses02F_script02_1_M001	 This is great, isn't it?  Look at the night we've got here, couldn't be better.	Ses02F-script02-07-01-1_M001.wav	07
Ses01M_impro06_M014	 It was kind of like boom... done	Ses01M-impro06-04-01-M014.wav	04
Ses05F_script03_2_F004	 maybe just a little, but--	Ses05F-script03-01-01-2_F004.wav	01
Ses01M_script02_1_M031	 Well, okay whatever, okay but it's a fish who do something that like no other fish do, you know, it's like those swallows that return to Capistrano or those like those lemmings that jumped off the cliffs, you know.	Ses01M-script02-07-01-1_M031.wav	07
Ses01M_impro05_F027	 What was that?	Ses01M-impro05-01-01-F027.wav	01
Ses03F_impro06_F001	 Yeah. Wow.	Ses03F-impro06-04-01-F001.wav	04

Ses05F_impro03_F000	 Okay, so big news.	Ses05F-impro03-07-01-F000.wav	07
Ses01F_impro05_M008	 Uh-huh.	Ses01F-impro05-01-01-M008.wav	01
Ses01M_impro05_F032	 That's not - no.	Ses01M-impro05-01-01-F032.wav	01
Ses02F_script03_1_M026	 The one when you bought that little painted wooden snake in the Piazza and put it on my bed.	Ses02F-script03-01-01-1_M026.wav	01
Ses04F_script03_1_F022	 Which particular one?	Ses04F-script03-07-01-1_F022.wav	07
Ses02M_impro02_M000	 I know, I know. I don't want to go either baby. I love you know. And I'm going to miss you a lot.	Ses02M-impro02-04-01-M000.wav	04

Ses01F_script02_2_F040	 You're the one who probably wishes he was with somebody else.  Somebody who doesn't take things so seriously, who could enjoy herself.	Ses01F-script02-04-01-2_F040.wav	04
Ses04F_impro07_M023	 You- you- you'll find.	Ses04F-impro07-01-01-M023.wav	01

Ses04M_script03_2_F024	 It's a pity you didn't- It's a pity you didn't have more brandy.	Ses04M-script03-01-01-2_F024.wav	01
Ses02M_impro03_F018	 Are your parents excited or...?	Ses02M-impro03-07-01-F018.wav	07
Ses03M_script01_3_M032	 That's just a little thing but that's the kind of guys I had.  They didn't just die, they killed themselves for each other and I mean that exactly.	Ses03M-script01-04-01-3_M032.wav	04
Ses03F_impro07_F008	 Yes, me, I got in. Thank you very much.	Ses03F-impro07-07-01-F008.wav	07

Ses02F_script01_3_M001	 You're not sorry you came?	Ses02F-script01-01-01-3_M001.wav	01
Ses02F_impro06_M007	 'Cause, you know, you've got all the times that you guys did spend together, you know and that's something good that you can look back on.	Ses02F-impro06-01-01-M007.wav	01
Ses05M_impro03_M029	 Well, we're going to take a little bit of time, you know, we need to get acclimated and you know start our lives, make money, you know be comfortable.	Ses05M-impro03-07-01-M029.wav	07
Ses03F_impro08_M006	 You know what?  I'm just going to- Patient?  I'm a busy man.	Ses03F-impro08-05-01-M006.wav	05

Ses04M_script03_2_M036	 I'm not in the least drunk.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M036.wav	05
Ses04F_script01_2_M000	 Why does that bother you?	Ses04F-script01-01-01-2_M000.wav	01
Ses01F_script03_2_F021	 They sting. I don't care.  Do you understand?  I don't care if they bark and they roll about like hoops.	Ses01F-script03-05-01-2_F021.wav	05
Ses02M_script02_1_F017	 Yes.	Ses02M-script02-01-01-1_F017.wav	01
Ses04F_impro07_M080	 No, no, no.  You're right though.  I mean, you know, dorms are definitely the way to meet people.  I know that I was in an apartment off campus	Ses04F-impro07-01-01-M080.wav	01
Ses01M_impro03_M015	 It's a good idea.	Ses01M-impro03-07-01-M015.wav	07
Ses04F_script01_1_M026	 I wanted to get this settled first.	Ses04F-script01-04-01-1_M026.wav	04

Ses02M_impro04_M014	 I don't know, it's just not, I don't know - I don't know what to do really, you know, I'm just thinking	Ses02M-impro04-04-01-M014.wav	04
Ses01F_impro06_F004	 Thank you.	Ses01F-impro06-01-01-F004.wav	01
Ses02M_script01_3_M034	 I mean, you can take those things out of a war, but when you drive that car, you've gotta realize that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've gotta be a little better because of it.	Ses02M-script01-04-01-3_M034.wav	04

Ses03F_script03_2_M000	 As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.	Ses03F-script03-05-01-2_M000.wav	05
Ses04F_impro02_F011	 What's that supposed to mean?	Ses04F-impro02-04-01-F011.wav	04

Ses01M_impro05_F012	 so you flew in from Atlanta...	Ses01M-impro05-01-01-F012.wav	01

Ses01F_script03_2_M001	 However I believe the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.	Ses01F-script03-01-01-2_M001.wav	01
Ses01M_impro07_F015	 I don't know. Commuting from what Malibu that would be ridiculous.	Ses01M-impro07-07-01-F015.wav	07

Ses05M_impro04_F023	 Okay so.	Ses05M-impro04-01-01-F023.wav	01
Ses01F_script01_3_M032	 To bring that on to the earth again, you know, is like some kind of monument and I thought I would just make a difference to them.	Ses01F-script01-04-01-3_M032.wav	04
Ses03F_script02_2_F005	 Augie, Goddamn it, don't ask me that. You always ask me that. Why do you ask me that? I hate it. It's insulting.	Ses03F-script02-05-01-2_F005.wav	05

Ses04M_script01_1_M022	 Sometimes you infuriate me, you know that?  Isn't it your business, too, if I tell this to father and he throws a fit about it?  You have such a talent for ignoring things.	Ses04M-script01-05-01-1_M022.wav	05
Ses01F_impro01_F012	 That's out of control.	Ses01F-impro01-05-01-F012.wav	05
Ses02M_impro05_F011	 I understand that. Um- So I'm going to put down here that you looking for your baggage, but we actually can't, uh this bag is likely not going to show up so what we're going to do-	Ses02M-impro05-01-01-F011.wav	01
Ses05F_script03_1_M027	 How long did that row last?	Ses05F-script03-07-01-1_M027.wav	07
Ses03F_script01_3_F003	 No. I'm not sorry. It's-	Ses03F-script01-04-01-3_F003.wav	04

Ses05M_script03_2_F012	 It's becoming a habit with you.	Ses05M-script03-01-01-2_F012.wav	01
Ses01F_script02_1_M014	 Huh.  Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  No?  you know, we should have brought the blanket?  Our blanket.	Ses01F-script02-01-01-1_M014.wav	01
Ses03F_impro06_F011	 He's so young. It seems so--	Ses03F-impro06-04-01-F011.wav	04
Ses01M_impro04_F011	 No.  I'm just saying though that if I was a person who was hiring somebody I-- --would not hire someone who was angry or upset.	Ses01M-impro04-01-01-F011.wav	01
Ses01F_impro07_M004	 Oh.  Good, good.  That's awesome. Are you going to stay around here?  Or are you going to like get a different neighborhood- you going to move to a different neighborhood?	Ses01F-impro07-07-01-M004.wav	07
Ses03M_impro05a_F016	 Okay.  We will find your luggage.  Apparently because it somehow...what flight you were taking, you were on Delta?	Ses03M-impro05a-01-01-F016.wav	01
Ses02M_script01_1_F018	 Well, you want to make sure that your father isn't-	Ses02M-script01-01-01-1_F018.wav	01
Ses01F_script03_2_F031	 There are no people upstairs; it's a photographer's studio.	Ses01F-script03-01-01-2_F031.wav	01
Ses01F_impro03_F022	 Fifty bucks. Mmhmm.	Ses01F-impro03-01-01-F022.wav	01
Ses05F_script01_3_M030	 I mean that exactly that-a little more selfish and they would have still been here today.	Ses05F-script01-04-01-3_M030.wav	04
Ses01F_impro07_F013	 I would be like- Oh. Right, right, right.	Ses01F-impro07-07-01-F013.wav	07
Ses02M_impro05_F024	 The airline can't afford to give you everything that is in that suitcase. and so-	Ses02M-impro05-01-01-F024.wav	01
Ses02M_impro06_M010	 She was [garbage]	Ses02M-impro06-04-01-M010.wav	04
Ses04F_script02_2_F026	 No.	Ses04F-script02-04-01-2_F026.wav	04
Ses04M_script03_1_M007	 With the mo- with the most perfect poise?	Ses04M-script03-07-01-1_M007.wav	07
Ses03M_script03_2_M000	 Yes.  The real cause of that rile was Peter Burden.	Ses03M-script03-01-01-2_M000.wav	01
Ses03M_script03_2_F045	 Beast. Brute. Cad. Swine. Beast. Beast. Brute. Devil. Sorry.	Ses03M-script03-05-01-2_F045.wav	05
Ses03M_impro04_M008	 I'm smarter than half the people I work for.	Ses03M-impro04-05-01-M008.wav	05
Ses03F_impro04_F024	 Yeah	Ses03F-impro04-04-01-F024.wav	04
Ses05F_script03_2_M042	 You are a vile tempered, loose living, wicked little beast, and I never want to set eyes on you again.	Ses05F-script03-05-01-2_M042.wav	05
Ses01M_impro07_M009	 Where should I move?	Ses01M-impro07-07-01-M009.wav	07
Ses04M_script03_2_F037	 There aren't any people upstairs.  It's a photographer's studio.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_F037.wav	05
Ses03M_script02_2_M033	 Right.	Ses03M-script02-05-01-2_M033.wav	05
Ses04M_script02_1_F010	 So let's go home.	Ses04M-script02-05-01-1_F010.wav	05
Ses05F_impro07_F002	 U.S.C..	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-F002.wav	07
Ses02M_impro02_M014	 and it'll work out you know, go there and do that. Yeah, I'll be back	Ses02M-impro02-01-01-M014.wav	01
Ses05M_script02_2_F022	 No.	Ses05M-script02-04-01-2_F022.wav	04
Ses04F_impro03_F036	 Yes.	Ses04F-impro03-07-01-F036.wav	07
Ses01M_impro06_F006	 He sick for awhile?	Ses01M-impro06-04-01-F006.wav	04
Ses05M_impro05_M001	 So, um, what do I do?	Ses05M-impro05-01-01-M001.wav	01
Ses05F_script02_2_F027	 But this isn't anything like I thought it would be.	Ses05F-script02-04-01-2_F027.wav	04
Ses04F_impro08_M001	 Um, I basically, um I- I ordered some food	Ses04F-impro08-01-01-M001.wav	01
Ses03M_script01_3_F033	 that includes me too, I mean and the money, you have right to that money.  Your father put planes up in the air, good planes and he deserves it, you should be proud of that.  A man should be paid for that.	Ses03M-script01-04-01-3_F033.wav	04
Ses03M_script02_2_F034	 This is just this.  You know?  I mean it's a lot and everything but it isn't somewhere else.  Do you know what I'm trying to say?	Ses03M-script02-04-01-2_F034.wav	04
Ses01F_script01_3_M000	 I know.  It kind of went out of style, didn't it?	Ses01F-script01-01-01-3_M000.wav	01
Ses02F_script01_2_M018	 What have I got to hide?  What the hell is the matter with you Kate?	Ses02F-script01-05-01-2_M018.wav	05
Ses02F_script03_1_M012	 You mustn't be serious, my dear one.  That's just what they want.	Ses02F-script03-01-01-1_M012.wav	01
Ses01F_impro05_M026	 You know, the airlines can not be held responsible for every bag of luggage that comes through here.	Ses01F-impro05-01-01-M026.wav	01
Ses05M_script03_2_M029	 Oh, really?  How about a child of three, or child of six, what about a child of nine?	Ses05M-script03-05-01-2_M029.wav	05
Ses02F_impro07_F024	 I mean I'm gonna take a bunch of stuff and see.	Ses02F-impro07-07-01-F024.wav	07

Ses01F_impro06_M008	 How long were you there for?	Ses01F-impro06-01-01-M008.wav	01
Ses04M_script03_2_F022	 Oh, no, it isn't.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_F022.wav	05
Ses02M_impro04_M019	 this doesn't happen to a normal person.	Ses02M-impro04-05-01-M019.wav	05
Ses02F_impro04_F016	 I just wanna crawl in a hole, you know.  Like it just makes you not wanna even open your eyes in the morning.	Ses02F-impro04-04-01-F016.wav	04
Ses03M_script02_2_M031	 ...and you know?  Baby the jokes on us.  Because you know what you get?  Do you know what you get Carla?  You get this.	Ses03M-script02-05-01-2_M031.wav	05
Ses04F_script02_1_M035	 No one sent them a map or an invitation.  Just some little instinctual time release firecracker went off in their little bodies and all as one. They turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming.	Ses04F-script02-07-01-1_M035.wav	07
Ses03F_script03_1_F000	 [BREATHING]	Ses03F-script03-01-01-1_F000.wav	01

Ses02F_impro01_F018	 Well, why didn't the D.M.V. put that you needed your birth certificate on the application then?	Ses02F-impro01-05-01-F018.wav	05
Ses01M_impro06_F021	 Mmhmm.	Ses01M-impro06-01-01-F021.wav	01
Ses03M_impro03_M028	 About two and a half weeks.	Ses03M-impro03-01-01-M028.wav	01
Ses02M_impro05_M026	 I mean you're not helping me here. What do I have to do here? Do I need to sue the airline company is that what I should do	Ses02M-impro05-05-01-M026.wav	05
Ses04M_script02_1_M028	 no, it's just seaweed, isn't it?  Oh, man, this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for anything.  I mean, think about this.  I know you're not interested, but just think about this for a minute.	Ses04M-script02-07-01-1_M028.wav	07
Ses01M_impro05_M025	 Well you need to find it. Can I just go back there and look through the bags?  Can I just go back there and just go through maybe I'll find it.	Ses01M-impro05-05-01-M025.wav	05
Ses01M_impro05_F013	 Four...Four hours ago.	Ses01M-impro05-01-01-F013.wav	01
Ses04F_script03_2_M005	 You let him kiss you.  You said you did.	Ses04F-script03-05-01-2_M005.wav	05
Ses05F_script01_1_M025	 To hell with that!	Ses05F-script01-05-01-1_M025.wav	05
Ses05M_impro07_M028	 Not a lot.  I mean, I wouldn't want to live with more than three other people.  So, like four of us total, right?	Ses05M-impro07-07-01-M028.wav	07
Ses02F_impro02_F001	 There's nothing I can do.  I mean, the government you know--	Ses02F-impro02-04-01-F001.wav	04
Ses04M_script03_1_F012	 Who's they?	Ses04M-script03-07-01-1_F012.wav	07
Ses03F_script01_2_M017	 What have I got to hide?	Ses03F-script01-05-01-2_M017.wav	05
Ses02F_impro04_M008	 I know.  It makes it harder.  I mean it's definitely who you know in a lot of cases, but--	Ses02F-impro04-01-01-M008.wav	01

Ses05F_impro01_F018	 Why not?	Ses05F-impro01-05-01-F018.wav	05
Ses02F_impro05_F000	 Hi, um, excuse me, I believe that the airline lost my baggage.	Ses02F-impro05-01-01-F000.wav	01

Ses05M_script03_2_M036	 I do I shall do no such thing.	Ses05M-script03-05-01-2_M036.wav	05
Ses04M_script01_2_F001	 Why does that bother you?	Ses04M-script01-01-01-2_F001.wav	01
Ses05F_impro05_M032	 Well, it's like any kind of insurance.  You don't-when you get it, then you get more. You know, Like if you--	Ses05F-impro05-01-01-M032.wav	01
Ses02F_script02_2_M017	 Okay, so I'm putting on my jacket, putting out the animals, getting the car out of the garage--	Ses02F-script02-01-01-2_M017.wav	01
Ses05F_script03_2_M013	 You needn't be so grand simply because you don't happen to want any at the moment.	Ses05F-script03-05-01-2_M013.wav	05
Ses01M_impro03_M024	 Will you help me plan?	Ses01M-impro03-07-01-M024.wav	07
Ses02M_script03_2_F019	 Be quiet.	Ses02M-script03-05-01-2_F019.wav	05
Ses03M_script01_1_M004	 No.  I figured the best thing to do was leave him alone.	Ses03M-script01-04-01-1_M004.wav	04
Ses03F_impro08_M012	 A free calling card?	Ses03F-impro08-05-01-M012.wav	05
Ses05F_script02_2_M032	 Maybe if you are with somebody else too?	Ses05F-script02-04-01-2_M032.wav	04
Ses05M_impro08_M011	 Yeah, well, absolutely.  What we can -- let's just go ahead and just do a basic diagnostic of your system first off, okay.  Can you go down to your start button?	Ses05M-impro08-01-01-M011.wav	01
Ses01M_script02_2_M023	 It was when we were driving passed that knickerbocker liquor locker and you would said, no you said "let's get some champagne" and I said "no time to wasting" or something like that.  That's what it is, right?	Ses01M-script02-01-01-2_M023.wav	01
Ses04M_impro07_M000	 Alright, so you're not going to believe this.  But I went home today. I looked through the mail.  And I got an acceptance letter from U.S.C..	Ses04M-impro07-07-01-M000.wav	07
Ses02M_impro07_F011	 So can we hang out?	Ses02M-impro07-07-01-F011.wav	07
Ses05M_script01_1_M025	 To hell with that!	Ses05M-script01-05-01-1_M025.wav	05
Ses05F_script01_3_M032	 but it seemed to me that something new was being created at the same time, a kind of responsibility, man for man.  Do you understand me?	Ses05F-script01-04-01-3_M032.wav	04
Ses01M_impro05_F018	 --arriving any time soon.	Ses01M-impro05-01-01-F018.wav	01
Ses04F_script02_2_F006	 We just have different ideas about what this evening is supposed to look like.	Ses04F-script02-05-01-2_F006.wav	05
Ses01F_impro07_M017	 Yay...School's fun.	Ses01F-impro07-07-01-M017.wav	07
Ses03F_script01_1_M018	 I want to ask her to marry me.	Ses03F-script01-01-01-1_M018.wav	01
Ses02M_impro04_M022	 Right. Thanks for talking to me.	Ses02M-impro04-04-01-M022.wav	04
Ses04F_impro08_M022	 Cindy?  Cindy what?	Ses04F-impro08-05-01-M022.wav	05
Ses01F_script01_2_F009	 Nobody in this house dares take away her faith, Joe.  You know strangers might, but not his father, not his brother.	Ses01F-script01-05-01-2_F009.wav	05
Ses05M_impro05_F016	 Wow.  Well, that's really important, obviously.  But, um --	Ses05M-impro05-01-01-F016.wav	01
Ses01F_impro04_F032	 The bus, I'm riding the bus because I want to.	Ses01F-impro04-05-01-F032.wav	05
Ses05F_impro06_F016	 I can't imagine what his- what his parents are going through.	Ses05F-impro06-04-01-F016.wav	04
Ses02M_impro08_M021	 so it is a little a little hard in that situation if you want -- you know you can -um- we can- we can issue another credit card.	Ses02M-impro08-01-01-M021.wav	01
Ses04F_script01_3_M035	 a sort of responsibility man for man.  You understand me?	Ses04F-script01-04-01-3_M035.wav	04
Ses04F_impro06_M003	 Yeah.	Ses04F-impro06-04-01-M003.wav	04
Ses05F_impro07_M015	 You're going to have so much fun.  And there's lo- tons of people, you're going to meet so many people, I'm going to meet so many people too, because we're going to be there together.	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-M015.wav	07
Ses02M_impro07_F025	 Well, there are all kinds of awesome secrets so you'll really enjoy it. It's really great. I'm so glad.	Ses02M-impro07-07-01-F025.wav	07
Ses04M_script03_2_F051	 Never, never, never.  I'd rather die in torment. Beast brute.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_F051.wav	05
Ses01M_script03_2_F035	 Very well if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.	Ses01M-script03-05-01-2_F035.wav	05
Ses04M_impro06_F007	 How's, um -- how's his parents doing?	Ses04M-impro06-04-01-F007.wav	04
Ses05M_script01_3_M039	 And I guess that included you.	Ses05M-script01-04-01-3_M039.wav	04
Ses02M_impro05_M002	 Yes, yes, it's gone around like you know twenty times. It's been about a half hour.	Ses02M-impro05-01-01-M002.wav	01
Ses04F_impro07_F048	 Okay well that's not a happy part.  We don't want to talk about that.	Ses04F-impro07-07-01-F048.wav	07
Ses04M_impro06_F004	 But, I'm here if there's anything you need.  I mean, you just have to ask.  I know --	Ses04M-impro06-04-01-F004.wav	04
Ses01F_script01_3_M027	 Pretty much all.	Ses01F-script01-04-01-3_M027.wav	04
Ses01F_impro03_F018	 Penny slots. That's what he plays.	Ses01F-impro03-01-01-F018.wav	01
Ses05F_script03_2_F018	 Um, It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.	Ses05F-script03-05-01-2_F018.wav	05
Ses01F_script01_3_F006	 Sort of embarrassed ever since I got here.	Ses01F-script01-01-01-3_F006.wav	01
Ses04M_script01_1_M014	 For God's sake, three years.  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane.	Ses04M-script01-05-01-1_M014.wav	05
Ses02M_impro03_F014	 She must have flipped out.	Ses02M-impro03-07-01-F014.wav	07
Ses01M_script02_1_F008	 I'm fine.	Ses01M-script02-01-01-1_F008.wav	01
Ses05F_impro05_M001	 On what airline?	Ses05F-impro05-01-01-M001.wav	01
Ses03M_script02_1_M035	 You know, this is great isn't it?  You know, I wouldn't trade this for anything.	Ses03M-script02-07-01-1_M035.wav	07
Ses02M_script03_1_M014	 flippancy brings out the acid in their damned sweetness in light.	Ses02M-script03-07-01-1_M014.wav	07
Ses05F_script03_2_F000	 You knew there was nothing in that.	Ses05F-script03-01-01-2_F000.wav	01
Ses04F_script03_1_F012	 Who's they?	Ses04F-script03-01-01-1_F012.wav	01
Ses01F_impro02_F016	 I have to find sitters.	Ses01F-impro02-01-01-F016.wav	01
Ses05M_script01_1b_F000	 What's he going to say?  Maybe we ought to tell him before he sees it.	Ses05M-script01-04-01-1b_F000.wav	04
Ses03M_script01_2_F012	 No.  Nobody in my house better dare and challenge her faith.  You know and maybe strangers but not his father, not his brother.	Ses03M-script01-05-01-2_F012.wav	05
Ses02M_script02_2_M021	 Yea. Okay, sure, no. I see. Listen, you want to dance?	Ses02M-script02-01-01-2_M021.wav	01
Ses05M_impro02_F012	 What would be the worst that would happen if they found you somewhere else?	Ses05M-impro02-01-01-F012.wav	01
Ses01F_impro02_F013	 You'll videotape everything, yeah?	Ses01F-impro02-04-01-F013.wav	04
Ses03M_impro02_M031	 What do you mean?	Ses03M-impro02-04-01-M031.wav	04
Ses03M_impro05b_M019	 I work for IBM.	Ses03M-impro05b-01-01-M019.wav	01
Ses01F_script01_3_F015	 I almost got married two years ago.	Ses01F-script01-01-01-3_F015.wav	01
Ses04F_impro07_F059	 Okay.  No, that's dorky.	Ses04F-impro07-07-01-F059.wav	07
Ses05F_impro06_F000	 A good friend of mine passed away the other day.	Ses05F-impro06-04-01-F000.wav	04
Ses02F_impro08_F013	 So, you will absolutely be in a high rated great hotel and we can make sure that it's in a area of town that you like as well.	Ses02F-impro08-01-01-F013.wav	01
Ses04M_impro06_F003	 I'm sorry.  It's never easy.	Ses04M-impro06-04-01-F003.wav	04
Ses03M_impro07_M023	 Some miso soup.  You can get whatever.  You can get a vat full of miso soup.  God.	Ses03M-impro07-07-01-M023.wav	07
Ses01F_impro07_M018	 Of course, right.  That's where the real money is, being a student.	Ses01F-impro07-01-01-M018.wav	01
Ses02M_script03_2_F035	 You are far too temperamental. Try to control yourself.	Ses02M-script03-05-01-2_F035.wav	05
Ses01M_script02_2_F046	 Augie, I'm sorry.	Ses01M-script02-04-01-2_F046.wav	04
Ses04F_script03_2_M000	 As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.	Ses04F-script03-01-01-2_M000.wav	01
Ses05F_impro07_F011	 Whoa, this is going to be so much fun.	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-F011.wav	07
Ses03F_script01_1_F005	 He cried hard, huh?	Ses03F-script01-01-01-1_F005.wav	01
Ses02F_impro04_M009	 But you gotta.  Otherwise, what is--what's your other option?	Ses02F-impro04-01-01-M009.wav	01
Ses03F_script03_2_M042	 No, you're not going out like this. No you're not.	Ses03F-script03-05-01-2_M042.wav	05
Ses05M_impro04_F013	 Maybe [garbage].	Ses05M-impro04-01-01-F013.wav	01
Ses01M_script01_1_M007	 I guess he is.	Ses01M-script01-04-01-1_M007.wav	04
Ses05M_impro05_M003	 And so I waited there, but nothing came.	Ses05M-impro05-01-01-M003.wav	01
Ses01M_script03_2_F041	 Oh yes I am...Oh yes I am. Let go of me. You let go. You...urgh...You're a cruel friend. I loathe and I hate you. Marry you again...Ha...Never, never, never, never. I hope you die in torment. You beast.	Ses01M-script03-05-01-2_F041.wav	05
Ses04F_script03_1_M027	 Do you remember that awful scene in Venice?	Ses04F-script03-01-01-1_M027.wav	01
Ses01M_script02_1_F017	 Pass what up?  These little fish swim out of the ocean, they flop around on the sand then they swim back and then they die.	Ses01M-script02-05-01-1_F017.wav	05
Ses02M_impro04_F009	 I'm sorry.	Ses02M-impro04-04-01-F009.wav	04

Ses01M_script03_2_M013	 Oh, you know no particular reason besides they are very small glasses.	Ses01M-script03-01-01-2_M013.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_1_M046	 Now, Annie's in the middle of all that.	Ses03F-script01-05-01-1_M046.wav	05

Ses02M_impro03_M000	 Oh, you're never going to believe it.	Ses02M-impro03-07-01-M000.wav	07
Ses03M_impro06_M020	 and then something like this happens you know?	Ses03M-impro06-04-01-M020.wav	04
Ses05F_impro08_M027	 three two three	Ses05F-impro08-01-01-M027.wav	01

Ses03F_impro08_F005	 Well, um- we have a little problem with the system going on.  One of our satellites is down, and I-	Ses03F-impro08-01-01-F005.wav	01
Ses04M_script03_2_F034	 Oh, shut up.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_F034.wav	05

Ses04F_impro05_F011	 Look fifty dollars is unacceptable.  My bag itself cost over a hundred and fifty dollars.  You can't just give me fifty dollar gift certificate to Percoes or whatever the hell and then send me off like that's- that's good enough.  Like that's all I needed was fifty dollars.  My bag is worth more than that.	Ses04F-impro05-05-01-F011.wav	05
Ses03F_impro07_M033	 Well, get used to it.	Ses03F-impro07-01-01-M033.wav	01
Ses02M_script02_2_F011	 I mean I feel like my whole life is going to be spent standing on the beach waiting for the fish to show up with my eyes open and my hands clasped expectantly and the fish won't show up.	Ses02M-script02-05-01-2_F011.wav	05
Ses03M_impro04_F025	 -it's going to get better I promise you. You just got to hang in there. Everyone, I mean, you know?	Ses03M-impro04-01-01-F025.wav	01
Ses05F_script02_1_M018	 Honey, this is a natural phenomenon. I mean,  It happens like once a year.  It's a great opportunity.	Ses05F-script02-07-01-1_M018.wav	07
Ses01M_impro02_M010	 ...we're all shipping out.	Ses01M-impro02-04-01-M010.wav	04
Ses01M_impro07_M003	 Yeah.  Well, I don't--well yeah I can pitch, I'm not like the pitcher though. I'm like the pinch hitter guy I mostly just hit.  But I guess I'm going to have to... Yeah, and then I play shortstop too but... It's so ex- The good news is I get to stay here.	Ses01M-impro07-07-01-M003.wav	07
Ses05M_script01_2_F005	 What's going on here, Joe?	Ses05M-script01-05-01-2_F005.wav	05
Ses05F_impro04_F019	 I'm just worried.	Ses05F-impro04-04-01-F019.wav	04
Ses05M_script01_3_F024	 Do you still feel like that?	Ses05M-script01-04-01-3_F024.wav	04

Ses04M_script01_3_M024	 It's all mixed up with so many other things.  You remember overseas, I was in command of a company?	Ses04M-script01-04-01-3_M024.wav	04
Ses05F_script01_3_M024	 Remember when I was overseas?  I was in command of the company.	Ses05F-script01-04-01-3_M024.wav	04
Ses02M_impro06_F002	 It doesn't make any easier, yes.	Ses02M-impro06-04-01-F002.wav	04
Ses05M_impro03_M003	 Oh my god, it was just last weekend.	Ses05M-impro03-07-01-M003.wav	07

Ses04M_script02_1_M031	 They're swimming right now as if that's the only thing that matters.  It's single mindedness with no mind.  Urgency that's pure urge.	Ses04M-script02-07-01-1_M031.wav	07
Ses05F_script03_1_M015	 Who knows?	Ses05F-script03-07-01-1_M015.wav	07

Ses03F_script02_1_M006	 Uh- you know, the flashlight. The silver one. There's only one, isn't there?	Ses03F-script02-07-01-1_M006.wav	07
Ses03F_impro08_F010	 Sir, I'm very sorry, but this is the way it is.  This- We have no control over it.  It's going to take-  -but you have to be patient with us.  You can use a calling card.  We will give you a free calling card to use.	Ses03F-impro08-01-01-F010.wav	01

Ses01F_script01_1_F041	 All right.  But you don't want to think like that because what the hell are we working for, Chris?  It's all for you.  This whole shooting match is for you.	Ses01F-script01-05-01-1_F041.wav	05
Ses04M_script02_2_M021	 It was in the car, right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker?  You said let's get some champagne and I said times a wasting or something like that.  Right?  That's it, right?  You want this to be like the other time.  That's it.  Of course.	Ses04M-script02-01-01-2_M021.wav	01
Ses04M_script01_1_M013	 We've gotta say it to him.	Ses04M-script01-05-01-1_M013.wav	05

Ses04M_script03_2_M027	 It's a pity you didn't have any more brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M027.wav	05
Ses02F_impro07_M016	 So...	Ses02F-impro07-01-01-M016.wav	01

Ses03F_impro03_F006	 And I'm like oh, he went to the- -the bathroom, but he didn't tell me, I didn't even notice him leaving. And all of a sudden, I swear to God, I'm sitting there and-	Ses03F-impro03-07-01-F006.wav	07
Ses03M_script01_1_M027	 Well to hell with that.	Ses03M-script01-05-01-1_M027.wav	05

Ses05F_impro04_M042	 But you've got to keep looking for other stuff. You've got to do it on your own, too.  Okay?	Ses05F-impro04-01-01-M042.wav	01
Ses05M_impro07_M032	 Really?	Ses05M-impro07-07-01-M032.wav	07
Ses04F_impro04_F016	 Okay. Okay, Fine.	Ses04F-impro04-05-01-F016.wav	05

Ses05M_impro07_M021	 yeah.	Ses05M-impro07-07-01-M021.wav	07
Ses01F_script01_3_M026	 Well I lost them.	Ses01F-script01-04-01-3_M026.wav	04
Ses05M_impro01_F003	 Yeah.  So, I can't -- I can't do anything-	Ses05M-impro01-01-01-F003.wav	01
Ses03F_impro02_F001	 Yeah?	Ses03F-impro02-01-01-F001.wav	01
Ses01M_script01_1_M041	 I am thinking like that.	Ses01M-script01-05-01-1_M041.wav	05
Ses04M_script01_3_M034	 to open that bank book; to drive the new car; to see the new refrigerator.  I mean, you can take these things out of a war, but when you drive the new car, you have to know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.	Ses04M-script01-04-01-3_M034.wav	04
Ses05M_script01_3_F025	 Because you can't feel like that anymore, Chris.  Because everything you have, you have a right to, me included.	Ses05M-script01-04-01-3_F025.wav	04
Ses03M_script01_3_M035	 And to show that and to bring that onto the earth again like some sort of monument standing right behind all of us and we could feel it and it would make a difference to him.	Ses03M-script01-04-01-3_M035.wav	04
Ses03F_impro04_M000	 Hey, you just got to keep on going.	Ses03F-impro04-01-01-M000.wav	01
Ses04F_impro08_F008	 Well I'm very sorry, sir.  They should have dealt with it at that particular branch.  I apologize for that, uh, but we can help you.  That's no worries.  We can take care of that.  So how much did you need to be refunded?	Ses04F-impro08-01-01-F008.wav	01
Ses05F_script03_2_F039	 Yeah, very amusing.  Let me go.  I'm getting out of here.  I can't believe I intended to marry you.	Ses05F-script03-05-01-2_F039.wav	05
Ses05M_script02_2_M016	 It was in the car, right?  When we were passing Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, Let's stop and get champagne. and I said that times a wasting or something like that, right?  You wanted it to be like it was before, right?	Ses05M-script02-01-01-2_M016.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_1_F021	 Well, that's only your business, Chris.	Ses03F-script01-01-01-1_F021.wav	01
Ses05F_script03_2_F036	 I- I hate you.	Ses05F-script03-05-01-2_F036.wav	05
Ses02M_script01_1_F035	 Must you be inspired?	Ses02M-script01-05-01-1_F035.wav	05
Ses05F_script03_1_F010	 The whole business is really rather ridiculous.	Ses05F-script03-01-01-1_F010.wav	01
Ses01M_impro06_F015	 Lock	Ses01M-impro06-01-01-F015.wav	01
Ses05F_impro04_M030	 putting your best foot forward? or you	Ses05F-impro04-01-01-M030.wav	01
Ses03F_impro02_F008	 And Uh- Yeah. Uh- They're going to need um- more nurses on call for uh- to go overseas to help out with the war.	Ses03F-impro02-04-01-F008.wav	04
Ses04M_impro04_F016	 Really?  Whose fault is it you don't have a job?	Ses04M-impro04-01-01-F016.wav	01
Ses02F_impro05_M004	 Uh, But, we are willing to reimburse you for the bag and and for the contents--	Ses02F-impro05-01-01-M004.wav	01
Ses05M_impro03_M000	 Guess what?	Ses05M-impro03-07-01-M000.wav	07
Ses03M_impro05a_M028	 Sir. Sir. Sir. Sir	Ses03M-impro05a-05-01-M028.wav	05
Ses05F_impro06_M012	 Was he very close to his family?	Ses05F-impro06-01-01-M012.wav	01
Ses05F_impro06_F018	 Thank you.	Ses05F-impro06-04-01-F018.wav	04
Ses03M_script01_3_F007	 you saw the way that she acted and then well, I mean, you, you were acting kind of...	Ses03M-script01-04-01-3_F007.wav	04
Ses05M_script03_2_M008	 Well, that's a nice point of view I must say.	Ses05M-script03-05-01-2_M008.wav	05
Ses02F_script03_2_F039	 I hate you.  Stop it.  Stop it.  I hate you, do you hear?  You're conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible.	Ses02F-script03-05-01-2_F039.wav	05
Ses04F_impro01_F009	 Okay.  What is it that I did wrong on the form that I have to start all over again?	Ses04F-impro01-05-01-F009.wav	05
Ses03M_script01_3_M019	 Oh God.  Annie, I kissed Annie.  I kissed Annie.	Ses03M-script01-07-01-3_M019.wav	07
Ses04M_impro07_F018	 Yeah.	Ses04M-impro07-07-01-F018.wav	07

Ses01F_impro07_M001	 Yeah. That is so awesome.	Ses01F-impro07-07-01-M001.wav	07
Ses01F_script02_2_M000	 Look at this, all of the hairs are standing up on my arm.	Ses01F-script02-07-01-2_M000.wav	07
Ses02F_impro06_M002	 I'm sorry to hear about that.	Ses02F-impro06-01-01-M002.wav	01
Ses05M_script01_1_F000	 What's he going to say?  Maybe we should tell him before he sees it.	Ses05M-script01-04-01-1_F000.wav	04
Ses04F_impro03_M040	 Wow.  I just- I- I- I feel like I'm going to faint.	Ses04F-impro03-07-01-M040.wav	07
Ses01M_script03_2_M041	 You're not going like this.	Ses01M-script03-05-01-2_M041.wav	05
Ses02F_impro06_M016	 No, you'll never forget him.	Ses02F-impro06-01-01-M016.wav	01
Ses02F_script03_2_F016	 A woman's job is to allure the man.  Watch me a minute, will you?	Ses02F-script03-07-01-2_F016.wav	07
Ses03F_impro02_M020	 I can't be that strong. A whole year.	Ses03F-impro02-04-01-M020.wav	04
Ses05M_script01_1_F026	 Well, the trouble is you never saw enough women.	Ses05M-script01-01-01-1_F026.wav	01
Ses03F_impro02_F026	 No, I have to go.	Ses03F-impro02-04-01-F026.wav	04
Ses01F_script03_2_F023	 Mind your own business.	Ses01F-script03-05-01-2_F023.wav	05
Ses02M_impro07_M029	 I mean you got to - you got to show me the ropes 'cause I've never been there before so I mean you know your way around already and- [LAUGHTER]	Ses02M-impro07-07-01-M029.wav	07
Ses01F_impro03_M020	 But the pennies always get you because you end up spending like, you know, fifty bucks.	Ses01F-impro03-01-01-M020.wav	01
Ses03M_impro07_M011	 This will be like high school but even better.	Ses03M-impro07-07-01-M011.wav	07
Ses01F_script02_1_M038	 Just all at once, they turned and they formed this line as long as the California coast.  And some instinctual little firecracker went off in their bodies and they all just turned as one and started swimming.	Ses01F-script02-07-01-1_M038.wav	07
Ses02F_impro08_F015	 Okay.	Ses02F-impro08-01-01-F015.wav	01
Ses02F_impro04_M000	 So, uh, so how's it been going?  I mean, you have any needs or anything?	Ses02F-impro04-01-01-M000.wav	01
Ses04F_impro07_M043	 Right, so we'll go there and then- and then we'll get some ice cream and maybe we'll go putt-putt golfing.	Ses04F-impro07-07-01-M043.wav	07
Ses02F_impro02_F003	 I don't think so.	Ses02F-impro02-04-01-F003.wav	04
Ses05M_impro05_F021	 [LAUGHTER] Okay.  Hold on.	Ses05M-impro05-01-01-F021.wav	01
Ses01M_impro05_F028	 That's unfortunate.	Ses01M-impro05-01-01-F028.wav	01
Ses03F_script03_2_M010	 So am I. Bored stiff. Want some brandy?	Ses03F-script03-01-01-2_M010.wav	01

Ses03M_script01_3_M031	 For instance, one time this...it had been raining several days and this one kid, he came up to me, he gave me his last pair of dry socks, put them in my pocket.	Ses03M-script01-04-01-3_M031.wav	04
Ses03M_script01_3_M030	 Takes a little while to toss that off cause they weren't just men.	Ses03M-script01-04-01-3_M030.wav	04
Ses02F_impro08_M005	 You- You can do that--You can do that now? I don't have to get like transferred through or anything like that.	Ses02F-impro08-01-01-M005.wav	01
Ses05F_impro04_M032	 Have you ever called them back and asked why you didn't get the job?	Ses05F-impro04-01-01-M032.wav	01
Ses02M_impro06_M013	 Gosh, I just hate I just hate to see her go.	Ses02M-impro06-04-01-M013.wav	04
Ses05F_script03_2_M008	 Well, that's a nice point of view I must say.	Ses05F-script03-05-01-2_M008.wav	05
Ses03M_impro02_F023	 You said two years.	Ses03M-impro02-04-01-F023.wav	04
Ses04F_script01_3_M032	 I put them in my pocket. that's only a little thing but these are the kind of guys I had.	Ses04F-script01-04-01-3_M032.wav	04
Ses03M_script02_1_M015	 I'm so stupid, I should've brought a six-pack.  God, I'm like a little kid.  It's amazing I get out of the house with my fly zipped up. Oh- [LAUGHTER]	Ses03M-script02-07-01-1_M015.wav	07
Ses04M_impro06_M008	 [BREATHING] I mean, there's nothing really to talk about.  He's gone and I'll never see him again.	Ses04M-impro06-04-01-M008.wav	04
Ses04F_impro07_F001	 My acceptance letter.	Ses04F-impro07-07-01-F001.wav	07
Ses01F_impro05_M010	 I don't see any record of it, and I-usually when I don't see a record of it, that means um-	Ses01F-impro05-01-01-M010.wav	01
Ses03F_script03_2_F035	 Turn it on.	Ses03F-script03-05-01-2_F035.wav	05
Ses02F_impro07_F007	 I know.  I know. And we'll all get to hang out.  And I'm--even though we'll be at like at different parts of the city, we can still, like...	Ses02F-impro07-07-01-F007.wav	07
Ses03F_impro08_F024	 Well, ten hours worth of minutes--	Ses03F-impro08-01-01-F024.wav	01
Ses03F_impro02_F005	 oh.	Ses03F-impro02-07-01-F005.wav	07

Ses03M_script02_2_F003	 Yeah.  Everyone else was sold the same thing.  I mean, look, it keeps us excited, it keeps us coming back for more and you know, keeps us thinking life's going to start any minute now.	Ses03M-script02-05-01-2_F003.wav	05
Ses03F_impro03_F004	 at the end of the performance, you know, like we're all clapping and stuff. And all of a sudden I look over and	Ses03F-impro03-07-01-F004.wav	07
Ses02F_script03_1_M029	 The worst one was in Cannes when your curling iron burnt a hole in my new dressing gown.	Ses02F-script03-01-01-1_M029.wav	01
Ses02F_script02_2_F034	 I know that you meant this to be special and nice and the sand and the moon and all, but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.	Ses02F-script02-04-01-2_F034.wav	04
Ses04F_impro03_M001	 Uh, you got a new car, a new house. Uh, a dog.	Ses04F-impro03-01-01-M001.wav	01
Ses03M_script01_1_F005	 He cried hard?	Ses03M-script01-04-01-1_F005.wav	04
Ses02M_script03_2_F007	 Well, if you hadn't been so nosey and suspicious you never wouldn't have known anything about it.	Ses02M-script03-01-01-2_F007.wav	01
Ses03F_impro08_F013	 -on average would use.	Ses03F-impro08-01-01-F013.wav	01

Ses03F_impro07_F027	 Are you going to come stay in my dorm with me sometime?	Ses03F-impro07-07-01-F027.wav	07

Ses01M_impro06_F024	 How long did you know each other?	Ses01M-impro06-01-01-F024.wav	01
Ses03M_script02_2_F037	 I didn't say that.	Ses03M-script02-04-01-2_F037.wav	04
Ses04M_script02_2_F006	 Goddamn it, Augie, don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  You always ask me that.  It's insulting.	Ses04M-script02-05-01-2_F006.wav	05
Ses03F_impro04_M001	 No, don't think like that.	Ses03F-impro04-01-01-M001.wav	01
Ses01F_impro04_M016	 Yeah.  But the piece of paper helps, too.	Ses01F-impro04-01-01-M016.wav	01
Ses02M_impro01_M003	 Um, no, I got my driver's license though.	Ses02M-impro01-01-01-M003.wav	01
Ses05F_impro01_M000	 ahh Yeah, this is the wrong line.  I'm sorry.  You need to go back over to line two B.  That's where you should have started from.	Ses05F-impro01-01-01-M000.wav	01
Ses04F_impro05_F015	 No.  No.  I don't know. You know what? I'm going to call my lawyer. You know what?  That's what I'm going to do.  I'm going to call my lawyer and have him get down here and explain to you that this is an unacceptable option.	Ses04F-impro05-05-01-F015.wav	05
Ses04F_impro07_F024	 So this works out perfectly.  Because I was worried if I didn't get in to U.S.C., then I would have to go somewhere far away and then-	Ses04F-impro07-07-01-F024.wav	07
Ses02M_impro06_M006	 God, it's you know, we've spent so much time with them it's just really surreal, really weird that we're not going to be able to see her anymore and go	Ses02M-impro06-04-01-M006.wav	04
Ses01M_script03_1_M014	 Darling, don't say that.	Ses01M-script03-04-01-1_M014.wav	04

Ses02M_impro06_M023	 Thank you.	Ses02M-impro06-04-01-M023.wav	04
Ses05M_script03_2_M026	 I'm sure you had a riotous time, no restrain at all, very enjoyable.  You never had much anyway.	Ses05M-script03-05-01-2_M026.wav	05
Ses05M_impro08_M018	 Okay?  Does it list your IP address there?	Ses05M-impro08-01-01-M018.wav	01
Ses02F_script01_1_M036	 I've been a good son too long.  A good sucker.  I'm through with it.	Ses02F-script01-05-01-1_M036.wav	05
Ses04M_script01_2_F010	 Because she knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my worst moments, I think of her waiting and I know, again, that I'm right.	Ses04M-script01-05-01-2_F010.wav	05
Ses05M_script03_1_M001	 I wonder.	Ses05M-script03-07-01-1_M001.wav	07
Ses04M_impro04_F001	 What about like a temp agency?	Ses04M-impro04-01-01-F001.wav	01
Ses01F_script02_1_M008	 Whose is it?	Ses01F-script02-01-01-1_M008.wav	01
Ses05M_impro07_M042	 Oh I know, I know.	Ses05M-impro07-07-01-M042.wav	07
Ses05F_impro05_F022	 Right, but part of the agreement is that I'm paying so that I can take myself and my belongings with me.	Ses05F-impro05-05-01-F022.wav	05
Ses03M_script03_2_M019	 Actually that's perfectly true.	Ses03M-script03-01-01-2_M019.wav	01
Ses02F_impro07_F003	 Yeah, I think, I mean because where else would I gonna go?  Like the other places that I applied to I really didn't like that much anyway.	Ses02F-impro07-07-01-F003.wav	07
Ses01F_script01_3_F022	 Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.	Ses01F-script01-01-01-3_F022.wav	01
Ses03F_impro02_M024	 It doesn't look very good.	Ses03F-impro02-04-01-M024.wav	04

Ses05F_impro04_M033	 Do they give you any specifics as to why they didn't go with you?	Ses05F-impro04-01-01-M033.wav	01
Ses01M_script02_2_M008	 Can I ask you a question?  Are you on your period?	Ses01M-script02-01-01-2_M008.wav	01
Ses04M_script02_1_M033	 Well so what did you think?	Ses04M-script02-07-01-1_M033.wav	07

Ses04M_script02_1_F014	 What are you so excited about?	Ses04M-script02-01-01-1_F014.wav	01

Ses01M_impro04_F022	 I'm just saying that maybe you should take in some information before you produce more of your own.	Ses01M-impro04-01-01-F022.wav	01
Ses01M_script02_1_M030	 Yeah, they do.	Ses01M-script02-01-01-1_M030.wav	01

Ses02F_script02_2_M036	 I'm doing the best I can.	Ses02F-script02-04-01-2_M036.wav	04
Ses02M_script02_2_F038	 You're the one who probably wishes he was with someone else, someone who knew how to enjoy herself and didn't take everything so hard.	Ses02M-script02-04-01-2_F038.wav	04
Ses05M_script02_1_M021	 I mean, this is a big night for these guys.  You know, life's last orgy.	Ses05M-script02-07-01-1_M021.wav	07
Ses03F_script02_2_F017	 We thought I was pregnant.	Ses03F-script02-04-01-2_F017.wav	04
Ses04M_impro03_F025	 All fruit and brown. [LAUGHTER]	Ses04M-impro03-07-01-F025.wav	07

Ses04F_script03_1_F024	 Yes, I know you did.  You threw him out of the window into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.	Ses04F-script03-07-01-1_F024.wav	07
Ses03M_script02_2_M020	 It was in the car right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker...	Ses03M-script02-01-01-2_M020.wav	01
Ses03M_script01_1_M000	 He saw it.	Ses03M-script01-04-01-1_M000.wav	04

Ses02F_impro06_M010	 .than you know, in pain and like this gradual, this horrible process.  I mean--	Ses02F-impro06-01-01-M010.wav	01
Ses02M_impro01_M018	 You- shouldn't you have like a sign or something maybe like up on the counter when you get the applica- maybe on the application	Ses02M-impro01-05-01-M018.wav	05
Ses04F_script03_1_F029	 How ridiculous.  How utterly, utterly ridiculous.	Ses04F-script03-07-01-1_F029.wav	07
Ses02M_script01_1_F041	 Yea, I can see that.	Ses02M-script01-04-01-1_F041.wav	04
Ses02M_impro08_M017	 Right. I mean we might	Ses02M-impro08-01-01-M017.wav	01
Ses02M_impro08_M018	 Okay.	Ses02M-impro08-01-01-M018.wav	01

Ses02M_script02_1_F005	 Yea.	Ses02M-script02-01-01-1_F005.wav	01
Ses04M_impro02_F020	 When do you leave?	Ses04M-impro02-04-01-F020.wav	04
Ses05M_impro04_F009	 I was just going to say that's your issue. Maybe you are going in too much. No, I mean, just	Ses05M-impro04-01-01-F009.wav	01
Ses05F_script01_3_F025	 Because you can't feel like that anymore Chris, you hear me?  I mean everything that you have, you deserve.  And that includes me.  And your father?  Your father put hundreds of planes in the air, you should be proud.  A man should be paid for that.	Ses05F-script01-04-01-3_F025.wav	04
Ses04M_script03_2_F041	 Go away.  Go away.  I hate you.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_F041.wav	05
Ses04M_script01_2_F012	 I want you to act like he's coming back, both of you.  Don't think I haven't noticed you since he invited her here.  I won't stand for any nonsense.	Ses04M-script01-05-01-2_F012.wav	05
Ses03M_script03_2_M014	 You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want any yourself at the moment.	Ses03M-script03-05-01-2_M014.wav	05
Ses04M_script01_3_M032	 There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them was some sort of bus accident.  Then I went to work for dad and that whole rat race again.  I felt, what you said, ashamed somehow	Ses04M-script01-04-01-3_M032.wav	04
Ses01M_script01_1_F031	 He thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl you're pronouncing him dead.	Ses01M-script01-04-01-1_F031.wav	04
Ses03F_script01_1_F053	 Yeah. I can see that.	Ses03F-script01-01-01-1_F053.wav	01
Ses05M_script01_2_F017	 I can't help it.	Ses05M-script01-05-01-2_F017.wav	05
Ses04M_script01_2_F006	 What's going on here, Joe?	Ses04M-script01-05-01-2_F006.wav	05
Ses04M_script02_2_F025	 No.	Ses04M-script02-05-01-2_F025.wav	05
Ses04F_impro02_M025	 You want me tell you that I'm okay with it?	Ses04F-impro02-04-01-M025.wav	04
Ses03M_impro08b_F021	 Alright. Well-  I guess - I guess that's okay but,	Ses03M-impro08b-01-01-F021.wav	01
Ses01M_impro05_M026	 It'll be a lot more than what you're doing sitting here and just give me lip service.  I'd like to go back at least do some aggressive searching for my stuff.	Ses01M-impro05-05-01-M026.wav	05
Ses02F_impro01_F000	 Hi. Excuse me.  Um, I'd like to put in this application for my registration.	Ses02F-impro01-01-01-F000.wav	01
Ses04F_script03_1_F026	 It burnt my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom.	Ses04F-script03-07-01-1_F026.wav	07
Ses01M_script02_2_M039	 Yeah, it is.	Ses01M-script02-01-01-2_M039.wav	01
Ses05F_impro06_F019	 Yeah, they're going to do some sort of memorial service or something.	Ses05F-impro06-04-01-F019.wav	04
Ses01F_script03_2_M007	 What about me?	Ses01F-script03-05-01-2_M007.wav	05
Ses01F_script02_1_F000	 Fine.	Ses01F-script02-01-01-1_F000.wav	01
Ses01F_impro03_F019	 Yeah.	Ses01F-impro03-01-01-F019.wav	01
Ses02F_impro08_F025	 Yeah--I completely understand.  It's a difficult process sometimes and we want to make traveling as easy as possible.	Ses02F-impro08-01-01-F025.wav	01
Ses03M_impro05a_M021	 Don't yell at me.	Ses03M-impro05a-05-01-M021.wav	05
Ses05M_script01_2_F004	 He's got that about it.	Ses05M-script01-01-01-2_F004.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_3_F028	 But, Chris, it wouldn't work like this.	Ses03F-script01-04-01-3_F028.wav	04
Ses01F_impro04_M022	 maybe get a car.	Ses01F-impro04-01-01-M022.wav	01
Ses05F_impro06_F026	 It's hard to say good-bye.	Ses05F-impro06-04-01-F026.wav	04
Ses01F_script02_2_F016	 For God's sake, this is not about fish.	Ses01F-script02-05-01-2_F016.wav	05
Ses04M_script02_1_F008	 There is no point in coming down here.	Ses04M-script02-05-01-1_F008.wav	05
Ses04F_impro07_M049	 Good. Alright we're so happy.	Ses04F-impro07-07-01-M049.wav	07
Ses04F_impro07_F066	 No.  But I'm thinking I might, you know, like audition for a play or something.  I don't really want to do the sorority thing.  I'm not really feeling that vibe with the	Ses04F-impro07-07-01-F066.wav	07
Ses01F_impro05_M020	 I know.	Ses01F-impro05-01-01-M020.wav	01
Ses03M_impro05b_M027	 And and, in about...	Ses03M-impro05b-05-01-M027.wav	05

Ses01M_script01_3_M025	 you know over seas I was in command of the company?	Ses01M-script01-04-01-3_M025.wav	04
Ses03F_script02_1_M015	 I'm so stupid. I'm like a little kid. I-it's amazing I get out of the house with my fly zipped. Oh- [LAUGHTER].	Ses03F-script02-07-01-1_M015.wav	07
Ses03M_script02_2_F016	 No we won't.  I mean, God, this isn't about the fish Augie.	Ses03M-script02-05-01-2_F016.wav	05
Ses04F_impro07_F051	 Yeah.  It will work out.  Maybe I could work at Red Lobster.	Ses04F-impro07-07-01-F051.wav	07
Ses04F_script01_2_M004	 How do you know he's even thinking about it?	Ses04F-script01-01-01-2_M004.wav	01
Ses03M_script01_2_F006	 No.  She's not his girl Joe and she knows that.	Ses03M-script01-05-01-2_F006.wav	05

Ses01F_script02_1_M033	 Ahh...we weren't in a good spot.	Ses01F-script02-01-01-1_M033.wav	01
Ses04F_impro08_F006	 Can you be a little more specific, sir?	Ses04F-impro08-01-01-F006.wav	01
Ses01M_script02_2_M043	 Maybe if you were with somebody else too?	Ses01M-script02-04-01-2_M043.wav	04
Ses03F_script02_2_M005	 Carla, can I ask you something? Don't take this wrong, but are you having your period?	Ses03F-script02-01-01-2_M005.wav	01

Ses04F_impro07_M026	 You'd have to, like go somewhere else, and, you know, we would be apart, and that would suck.	Ses04F-impro07-01-01-M026.wav	01
Ses05M_script02_2_F013	 Do you remember the first time that we came to see the grunion?  It was about four years ago right after we got married.  We thought I was pregnant.  We had a bottle of champagne and no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  We took off our shoes.  And while we were dancing you said the most intimate things to me right in my ear so I could feel them as much as hear them.	Ses05M-script02-04-01-2_F013.wav	04
Ses05M_script03_1_M009	 things that ought to matter most dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy, do they?	Ses05M-script03-07-01-1_M009.wav	07
Ses04M_impro07_F009	 I know.  It's a great school and you know	Ses04M-impro07-07-01-F009.wav	07

Ses04F_impro04_F013	 I don't even- I mean you have to have some kind of an idea.  Something you could possibly throw out there that I could maybe use.	Ses04F-impro04-05-01-F013.wav	05
Ses04F_impro01_F010	 Okay.  Well, I can do that right here right now without going to the back of the line again.  See look initialed.  All done. Ready to go.	Ses04F-impro01-05-01-F010.wav	05

Ses03M_script01_3_M033	 A little more selfish and they'd still be here today.  And I got this idea watching them go down.  See everything was being destroyed but there was one new thing that was being created.	Ses03M-script01-04-01-3_M033.wav	04
Ses04M_script01_1_F032	 Yes we did. Do you want to keep going?	Ses04M-script01-01-01-1_F032.wav	01
Ses01M_script03_2_M043	 Shut up. Shut up. I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling back to me on a bended knee. You are an evil tempered little vampire and I never want to see you again as long as I live.	Ses01M-script03-05-01-2_M043.wav	05
Ses01F_script03_2_M011	 No particular reason.  Anyhow, they are very small ones.	Ses01F-script03-01-01-2_M011.wav	01
Ses02F_script01_2_F012	 Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.  I mean, laugh--laugh at me, but...	Ses02F-script01-05-01-2_F012.wav	05

Ses02M_script03_2_M018	 As a matter of fact, that's perfectly true.	Ses02M-script03-01-01-2_M018.wav	01
Ses02M_script02_1_F021	 About what?	Ses02M-script02-01-01-1_F021.wav	01
Ses05F_script03_2_F027	 Not very funny, dear, you better have some more brandy.	Ses05F-script03-05-01-2_F027.wav	05
Ses03M_impro05b_M029	 Can you get it to the San Diego airport?  You get someone to drive it to my place alright? Then I get a refund for some...I get a free flight alright? I get free whatever.	Ses03M-impro05b-05-01-M029.wav	05
Ses01M_impro02_M011	 I just got I feel like I'm in shock actually.	Ses01M-impro02-04-01-M011.wav	04

Ses02M_script01_1_M038	 The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.	Ses02M-script01-05-01-1_M038.wav	05
Ses02M_script01_3_F021	 It wouldn't work this way.	Ses02M-script01-04-01-3_F021.wav	04

Ses01F_script01_2_F007	 Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men, why is she still single?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she waited.	Ses01F-script01-05-01-2_F007.wav	05
Ses05M_script01_2_F002	 Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.	Ses05M-script01-01-01-2_F002.wav	01
Ses02M_script03_2_M043	 You're not going like this.	Ses02M-script03-05-01-2_M043.wav	05

Ses02F_script01_3_M032	 And I felt what you said, ashamed somehow 'cause nobody was changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book, drive the new car, see the new refrigerator.	Ses02F-script01-04-01-3_M032.wav	04

Ses03M_impro07_M013	 I have some bad news.  I was like what?  She's like not really you got into U.S.C. and I was like, I was like oh my God.  I was about to tear my own hair out.	Ses03M-impro07-07-01-M013.wav	07
Ses01M_impro03_F009	 That's unbelievable... Yeah.	Ses01M-impro03-07-01-F009.wav	07

Ses05M_script02_2_M024	 Well, welcome to the human race.  Do you think this is what I had planned?  Do you think that when I proposed that I had this great fantasy going that four years down the road we would end up arguing on the beach over some fish?	Ses05M-script02-05-01-2_M024.wav	05
Ses05M_impro07_M045	 I had to tell you right away.  I knew you'd be excited.	Ses05M-impro07-07-01-M045.wav	07

Ses01M_script02_2_F010	 Why do you ask me that?  God damn it, I told you not to ask me that I hate it when you ask me that. It's insulting.	Ses01M-script02-05-01-2_F010.wav	05
Ses02F_script02_1_M010	 Right, of course.  Our flashlight.  Mine and yours.  I mean, me flashlight is su flashlight naturally.	Ses02F-script02-01-01-1_M010.wav	01
Ses05F_script02_2_F014	 We had a bottle of champagne but no glasses and you ask me to dance so we took off our shoes and while we were dancing, you said the most intimate things right in my ears so I could feel them as much as hear them.	Ses05F-script02-04-01-2_F014.wav	04
Ses02F_impro08_M011	 Well, it's gonna be four of them.	Ses02F-impro08-01-01-M011.wav	01

Ses02M_script02_1_M024	 Think about the people in Kansas, they- they'd have to get a plane ticket and hotel reservations to see this. We live forty minutes away it's too good to pass up.	Ses02M-script02-07-01-1_M024.wav	07
Ses01M_script03_2_M026	 I suppose you let him just kiss you or good deal more than too.	Ses01M-script03-05-01-2_M026.wav	05
Ses05F_script02_2_F017	 I rather not remember some things.  I rather not hope for some things.	Ses05F-script02-04-01-2_F017.wav	04
Ses04M_script02_2_F000	 Look at this, goose bumps.	Ses04M-script02-01-01-2_F000.wav	01
Ses04M_script01_1_M026	 I wanted to get this settled first.	Ses04M-script01-01-01-1_M026.wav	01
Ses04M_script01_3_M028	 For instance, one time it'd been raining several days.  And this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks; put them in my pocket.  That's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had.	Ses04M-script01-04-01-3_M028.wav	04

Ses01F_impro06_F028	 I remember, too, when we were--  she died at U.C.L.A.  She had brain surgery and there was not much hope to begin with, but I gave blood for her surgery, her mom and I before, so we dropped her off in the waiting room and then we were giving blood and came back.  And she, in her wheelchair, like can hardly do anything, reciting her poetry for these people like in the waiting room.  All she needs is a God damn audience.  You know?	Ses01F-impro06-04-01-F028.wav	04
Ses04F_script02_1_M033	 Ah, man this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for anything.  I mean think about this.  I know you're not interested but just think about this for a minute.	Ses04F-script02-07-01-1_M033.wav	07
Ses03F_impro06_F029	 Yeah. But then when he got cancer and it got bad, you know, she just took off and-	Ses03F-impro06-04-01-F029.wav	04
Ses04M_impro07_F004	 That's amazing.  I've seen it on TV. Um, Wow.  I mean, well what are you going to major in?  What are you going to do?	Ses04M-impro07-07-01-F004.wav	07

Ses02F_script03_2_M030	 We could get a good debate going about this, don't you think?  Intemperate tots.	Ses02F-script03-05-01-2_M030.wav	05
Ses05M_impro05_F012	 yeah, I don't know.	Ses05M-impro05-01-01-F012.wav	01
Ses05M_impro08_F013	 All right.	Ses05M-impro08-01-01-F013.wav	01
Ses02F_script01_1_F026	 [BREATHING] Have you asked Annie yet?	Ses02F-script01-01-01-1_F026.wav	01

Ses05M_script03_1_M029	 Oh, The worst one was in Cannes when your curling iron burnt a hole in my new dressing gown?	Ses05M-script03-07-01-1_M029.wav	07
Ses04F_script01_2_M017	 What does that mean, me above all?  Look at you.  You're shaking.	Ses04F-script01-05-01-2_M017.wav	05
Ses02F_script02_2_F031	 Well.  This isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.	Ses02F-script02-04-01-2_F031.wav	04
Ses04M_impro06_M012	 I mean, it's just not fair.  Like, I don't know.  Why people -	Ses04M-impro06-04-01-M012.wav	04
Ses05M_script02_1_M023	 All right.  But they are fish that do something no other fish do.  Like the swallows were turning into Capistrano or Lemmings jumping off the cliffs, you know like that. There's- There's magic here and mystery.  And a little bit of the unexplainable.  You know, I can't see how you could not be interested.	Ses05M-script02-07-01-1_M023.wav	07
Ses05F_script02_1_M011	 [LAUGHTER] I wonder if they can hear me talk or if they can feel the vibration in the sand when we are moving around	Ses05F-script02-07-01-1_M011.wav	07
Ses01F_impro05_M009	 Yeah. Yeah, I don't see- I don't see any--	Ses01F-impro05-01-01-M009.wav	01
Ses05F_impro03_M035	 [BREATHING]	Ses05F-impro03-07-01-M035.wav	07
Ses04F_script03_1_F028	 Then the manager came in and found us rolling about on the floor biting and scratching like panthers.	Ses04F-script03-07-01-1_F028.wav	07
Ses01F_impro03_F023	 Yeah.	Ses01F-impro03-01-01-F023.wav	01

Ses04M_script01_3_M030	 And I got this idea watching them go down, everything was being destroyed, see?  But, to me, it seemed there was one new thing that was made,	Ses04M-script01-04-01-3_M030.wav	04
Ses03F_impro02_F036	 It's all I ever knew how to do. I can't quit now.	Ses03F-impro02-04-01-F036.wav	04

Ses02F_script01_2_F013	 But why did that happen the very night she came here?  She sleeps in his room and his memorial breaks to pieces.  Just look.  Look at it.	Ses02F-script01-05-01-2_F013.wav	05
Ses02M_script02_2_F017	 And when we were dancing you said the softest most intimate things to me right into my ears so I could feel them as much as hear them	Ses02M-script02-04-01-2_F017.wav	04
Ses04F_impro01_M014	 Ma'am I have other people waiting in line right now.  I have other people waiting in line right now.	Ses04F-impro01-05-01-M014.wav	05
Ses02M_impro07_F001	 Um, I don't know, where?	Ses02M-impro07-07-01-F001.wav	07
Ses04F_impro07_M062	 Right or you can run for student counsel.	Ses04F-impro07-01-01-M062.wav	01
Ses03F_script02_2_F036	 Things have never turned out anything the way that I thought they would be.	Ses03F-script02-04-01-2_F036.wav	04
Ses05M_impro04_F022	 Not- Not selling pot, right?	Ses05M-impro04-01-01-F022.wav	01
Ses04M_script03_2_M030	 They -- nonsense, they have a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M030.wav	05

Ses05M_script03_2_F041	 You are a cruel fiend and I-I loath you.  I thank God I realized who you are before I decided to marry you again.  Oh my God, never!	Ses05M-script03-05-01-2_F041.wav	05
Ses02M_impro01_F006	 Um, that you would need to go home and get another form of ID and come back.	Ses02M-impro01-01-01-F006.wav	01

Ses05F_script01_1_F024	 Well you're a considerate fellow, there's nothing wrong with that.	Ses05F-script01-01-01-1_F024.wav	01
Ses01F_impro03_M016	 How much did he win at the slot?	Ses01F-impro03-01-01-M016.wav	01
Ses02M_script01_1_F037	 Well, you don't want to think like that.	Ses02M-script01-05-01-1_F037.wav	05
Ses03F_impro02_F038	 Don't do that to me.	Ses03F-impro02-04-01-F038.wav	04
Ses03M_script01_1_M009	 You know that Larry's not coming back and I know that too.  Why we both go on letting him think that we both believe with him.	Ses03M-script01-05-01-1_M009.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_F052	 Swine.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_F052.wav	05

Ses01M_script01_1_F030	 That's a good answer but it doesn't answer anything.  You haven't seen her since you went away to war, it's been five years.	Ses01M-script01-05-01-1_F030.wav	05
Ses05M_impro06_M019	 I just miss him.	Ses05M-impro06-04-01-M019.wav	04
Ses05M_script03_2_F001	 Only a trivial little broach.	Ses05M-script03-01-01-2_F001.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_3_M040	 And I felt wrong to be alive. To drive the car, to see the new checkbook, to see the new refrigerator. I mean, you can take those things out of the war. But you got to know that when you drive that car that that came out of the love a man can have for another man. And you got to be a little bit better because of that.	Ses03F-script01-04-01-3_M040.wav	04
Ses04M_impro07_M002	 Yeah, yeah.	Ses04M-impro07-07-01-M002.wav	07
Ses02F_script02_1_F021	 About what?	Ses02F-script02-01-01-1_F021.wav	01
Ses05M_script03_1_M018	 No.  That fire will fade along with our passion.	Ses05M-script03-07-01-1_M018.wav	07
Ses01F_script01_2_F008	 Because she knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my darkest moments, I think of her waiting and I know that I'm right.	Ses01F-script01-05-01-2_F008.wav	05
Ses02F_script01_1_F019	 What do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind.	Ses02F-script01-05-01-1_F019.wav	05
Ses03F_impro06_M013	 We need more people like him.	Ses03F-impro06-04-01-M013.wav	04
Ses01F_script01_3_F004	 For one thing, your mother much as told me to go.	Ses01F-script01-01-01-3_F004.wav	01
Ses01M_impro07_F010	 Oh.	Ses01M-impro07-01-01-F010.wav	01
Ses02M_script03_2_M046	 Shut up.	Ses02M-script03-05-01-2_M046.wav	05
Ses04M_impro08_F020	 You're just going to put it back on my account.	Ses04M-impro08-01-01-F020.wav	01
Ses03M_script01_1_M040	 The business doesn't inspire me.	Ses03M-script01-05-01-1_M040.wav	05
Ses05F_impro02_F028	 I know.	Ses05F-impro02-04-01-F028.wav	04
Ses01M_script01_3_M036	 And no one had changed it was just like sort of random bus accident to them.	Ses01M-script01-04-01-3_M036.wav	04
Ses04F_impro07_F041	 Eh, we can work that part out.	Ses04F-impro07-07-01-F041.wav	07
Ses01M_impro03_M020	 Yeah, like a big like- A wedding on the beach, that would be nice.	Ses01M-impro03-07-01-M020.wav	07
Ses03M_impro02_F032	 Honey I can't do it anymore.	Ses03M-impro02-04-01-F032.wav	04
Ses04M_script01_1_M021	 Well, then you know it's not only my business.	Ses04M-script01-05-01-1_M021.wav	05
Ses03F_script03_2_M038	 Turn it off.	Ses03F-script03-05-01-2_M038.wav	05
Ses01F_impro05_M016	 No.  I'm just giving you money, the bag is gone.  If it's not here, I'm really sorry there is nothing I can do because...	Ses01F-impro05-01-01-M016.wav	01
Ses05M_impro07_F037	 Yeah.	Ses05M-impro07-07-01-F037.wav	07
Ses03M_script02_2_M022	 You want this to be like the other time right?  That's it right?	Ses03M-script02-01-01-2_M022.wav	01
Ses01M_script01_2_F001	 It's been three and a half years.  Why all of a sudden?	Ses01M-script01-05-01-2_F001.wav	05
Ses04F_script02_2_M023	 You want me to get some champagne?	Ses04F-script02-01-01-2_M023.wav	01
Ses04F_impro03_F051	 [LAUGHTER] That's more than I needed to know.	Ses04F-impro03-07-01-F051.wav	07
Ses01M_script02_2_F032	 Oh, sure this is standing on the beach, this is waiting, fighting.	Ses01M-script02-05-01-2_F032.wav	05
Ses02F_impro05_F010	 Because you don't seem to care very much, you know.	Ses02F-impro05-05-01-F010.wav	05
Ses05F_impro06_F029	 yeah yeah.	Ses05F-impro06-04-01-F029.wav	04
Ses04M_impro05_F010	 I can't do that.	Ses04M-impro05-01-01-F010.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_2_M011	 All right. All right. Calm yourself.	Ses03F-script01-05-01-2_M011.wav	05
Ses01M_impro07_M001	 Well, this is totally random, I got this full ride scholarship to go to U.S.C next year to play softball.	Ses01M-impro07-07-01-M001.wav	07
Ses01F_impro03_M003	 Who did you marry?	Ses01F-impro03-07-01-M003.wav	07
Ses02F_impro05_M012	 You paid for the flight and then your bags were checked at--it's a service that the airline provides for us.  So so, really, it's really the risk was taken and, I'm sorry, but there's really nothing else we can do.  So do you want--do you want the reimbursement?	Ses02F-impro05-01-01-M012.wav	01
Ses05F_impro04_M041	 Okay.  Okay, I'll call some people.	Ses05F-impro04-01-01-M041.wav	01
Ses03F_impro07_F011	 And my mom was like Natalie, Natalie, it's [GARBAGE], you know-	Ses03F-impro07-07-01-F011.wav	07
Ses01F_script01_1_M007	 You know Larry is not coming back and I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?	Ses01F-script01-01-01-1_M007.wav	01
Ses03M_impro08a_M024	 All right um--	Ses03M-impro08a-01-01-M024.wav	01
Ses02M_script02_2_F006	 We just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like.	Ses02M-script02-05-01-2_F006.wav	05
Ses01F_impro03_M001	 Yeah.  I heard.	Ses01F-impro03-01-01-M001.wav	01
Ses03F_impro04_M007	 You don't owe me anything.	Ses03F-impro04-01-01-M007.wav	01
Ses02M_impro03_M001	 Well, I finally did it	Ses02M-impro03-07-01-M001.wav	07
Ses02M_impro05_F000	 Hi, can I help you?	Ses02M-impro05-01-01-F000.wav	01
Ses03F_impro03_M000	 Oh, my God, look at that. Huh-oh, how many carats is that?	Ses03F-impro03-07-01-M000.wav	07
Ses01F_script03_1_F012	 Who's they?	Ses01F-script03-07-01-1_F012.wav	07

Ses01M_impro06_F007	 Was it an accident?	Ses01M-impro06-01-01-F007.wav	01
Ses03M_script03_1_F005	 That sent shivers up my spine.	Ses03M-script03-07-01-1_F005.wav	07
Ses02M_script01_1_M021	 See it isn't just my business-	Ses02M-script01-05-01-1_M021.wav	05
Ses03F_script02_2_F025	 Hope for some things.	Ses03F-script02-04-01-2_F025.wav	04
Ses03M_impro06_F009	 How are they?	Ses03M-impro06-04-01-F009.wav	04
Ses02M_impro01_F000	 Hi, How can I help you?	Ses02M-impro01-01-01-F000.wav	01
Ses02M_script01_1_M018	 I'm going to ask her to marry me.	Ses02M-script01-01-01-1_M018.wav	01
Ses04M_script02_1_M030	 just some little instinctual time release firecracker went off in their little bodies and all as one, they turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming.	Ses04M-script02-07-01-1_M030.wav	07
Ses04M_impro06_F006	 I know.  It never is.	Ses04M-impro06-04-01-F006.wav	04
Ses02F_script01_2_F005	 It's got that all about it.	Ses02F-script01-05-01-2_F005.wav	05
Ses02F_script02_2_M020	 Yeah, of course, I see it now.  You want this to be like that other time, right?  That's it, right?	Ses02F-script02-01-01-2_M020.wav	01
Ses04F_script01_3_M036	 And then I came home and it was amazing.	Ses04F-script01-04-01-3_M036.wav	04
Ses05F_impro07_M024	 Woo- I I do.	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-M024.wav	07
Ses03F_script03_1_M020	 Let's blow strumpets, blow-blow trumpets and squeakers and party as much as we can like small quite idiotic school children. Let's savor the delight of the moment. Come, kiss me darling, before worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.	Ses03F-script03-07-01-1_M020.wav	07
Ses03F_script01_2_M001	 Well, maybe, maybe he just wanted to see her.	Ses03F-script01-01-01-2_M001.wav	01
Ses03F_impro08_F000	 Hello sir, can I help you?	Ses03F-impro08-01-01-F000.wav	01

Ses01F_script02_2_M006	 Carla, can I ask you something?  Now, don't take this the wrong way, but are you on your period?	Ses01F-script02-01-01-2_M006.wav	01
Ses03M_script03_1_F004	 I mean, it was, it's bound to come out sooner or later.	Ses03M-script03-07-01-1_F004.wav	07
Ses01F_script02_2_F023	 No.	Ses01F-script02-01-01-2_F023.wav	01

Ses01F_impro06_M009	 Mmhmm.	Ses01F-impro06-01-01-M009.wav	01
Ses04F_impro07_M009	 I know but you should get like a taser or something.  I mean walking around the campus at night-	Ses04F-impro07-01-01-M009.wav	01
Ses02F_impro08_F018	 Oh, yeah, absolutely.  Um- Would you like window seats or aisles?	Ses02F-impro08-01-01-F018.wav	01
Ses05M_impro04_F017	 Yeah.  That might be something you want to look at.  I mean --	Ses05M-impro04-01-01-F017.wav	01
Ses02M_impro06_M016	 I just -- I just don't get it, like there is just nothing you can do about it you know, it's like just out of your control and it	Ses02M-impro06-04-01-M016.wav	04
Ses02F_impro08_F006	 um lots of purchases, but we're gonna go ahead and give that to you anyway. uh,  Just to make sure that you're happy with your service here.	Ses02F-impro08-01-01-F006.wav	01
Ses05F_impro06_M019	 No problem.	Ses05F-impro06-01-01-M019.wav	01
Ses05F_script01_3_M009	 I- I -I have no imagination, that's all I know what to say, I-I'm embarrassing you. I I didn't want to tell you here.  I wanted it to be some place different, some place where we could be new to each other you know.	Ses05F-script01-07-01-3_M009.wav	07
Ses02F_impro07_F014	 Yeah, I mean there's all the money stuff and my mom's helping me with the financial aid and stuff.  But, it'll be fine--	Ses02F-impro07-07-01-F014.wav	07
Ses03F_script01_1_M008	 But I know one thing, mom. We've made a terrible mistake with dad.	Ses03F-script01-01-01-1_M008.wav	01
Ses04M_impro07_M020	 umm, and I'm going to check out school and get, you know, check out the courses	Ses04M-impro07-07-01-M020.wav	07
Ses04M_script01_1_F019	 Well you want to make sure your father isn't going to have --	Ses04M-script01-01-01-1_F019.wav	01
Ses05M_impro06_M008	 And he's gone now and I  -- I just can't believe it.	Ses05M-impro06-04-01-M008.wav	04
Ses03M_script02_2_F013	 Listen, I've waiting my entire life on this beach just standing there waiting for this fish to show up and these fish never show up.	Ses03M-script02-05-01-2_F013.wav	05
Ses03M_impro06_M006	 He was supposed to be the best man at my wedding.	Ses03M-impro06-04-01-M006.wav	04
Ses01F_script03_2_M020	 Oh really.  It's a pity you didn't have any brandy, it would have made you a little less disagreeable.	Ses01F-script03-05-01-2_M020.wav	05
Ses03M_impro06_M000	 I ah--	Ses03M-impro06-04-01-M000.wav	04
Ses01F_script02_1_M032	 And last year, I remember distinctly you said, you were so excited to get here that you don't remember you stubbed your toe until we were in the car.	Ses01F-script02-01-01-1_M032.wav	01
Ses05F_impro08_F016	 So in the database, it looks as though um, there is a there is like a glitch in the transaction where it hadn't gone through before, but I do see that you paid the, what can you tell me the amount, what was the amount?	Ses05F-impro08-01-01-F016.wav	01
Ses05M_script02_1_M019	 Yeah, but all that time on the beach is the highlight of their little lives.  You know,	Ses05M-script02-07-01-1_M019.wav	07
Ses05F_impro07_F015	 awesome.	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-F015.wav	07
Ses02F_impro07_F031	 Well, that'll take a while. [GARBAGE]	Ses02F-impro07-07-01-F031.wav	07
Ses01F_script02_2_F000	 That's the wind.	Ses01F-script02-01-01-2_F000.wav	01
Ses04M_script03_2_F047	 This is the end.  Do you understand, the end?  Finally and forever.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_F047.wav	05
Ses01F_script01_3_F005	 And then, you.  You've been kind of...	Ses01F-script01-01-01-3_F005.wav	01
Ses02M_impro06_F017	 Yes.	Ses02M-impro06-04-01-F017.wav	04

Ses03F_script01_3_F031	 Geez.	Ses03F-script01-04-01-3_F031.wav	04
Ses04M_script01_2_F003	 Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.	Ses04M-script01-05-01-2_F003.wav	05
Ses03F_script02_2_M001	 About what I was just saying.	Ses03F-script02-01-01-2_M001.wav	01
Ses05M_script03_2_F034	 Very well.  If you have to be boorish and idiotic.	Ses05M-script03-05-01-2_F034.wav	05
Ses05M_script02_1_F000	 Fine.	Ses05M-script02-04-01-1_F000.wav	04
Ses04F_impro04_M026	 Hey, I'd love to help you but I- you don't have the kind of training that I-	Ses04F-impro04-01-01-M026.wav	01
Ses03F_impro08_F022	 I don't know, sir.	Ses03F-impro08-01-01-F022.wav	01
Ses01M_impro05_M023	 Yeah it's really unfortunate you know why because I'm going to get fired if I don't get that.  So I need to have that back.	Ses01M-impro05-05-01-M023.wav	05
Ses03M_script02_2_F023	 I'd rather not remember something...	Ses03M-script02-04-01-2_F023.wav	04
Ses02M_script02_2_M023	 Take off our shoes?	Ses02M-script02-01-01-2_M023.wav	01
Ses01M_script02_1_M032	 It's like a little bit of the unexplainable, a little magic, a little mystery.  I just don't see how you can not be interested in this.	Ses01M-script02-07-01-1_M032.wav	07
Ses02F_impro07_F004	 So--	Ses02F-impro07-07-01-F004.wav	07
Ses04M_impro06_F010	 I mean, we can be grateful for that.	Ses04M-impro06-04-01-F010.wav	04
Ses03M_script01_1_M037	 But if I can't have that here I'll get out.	Ses03M-script01-01-01-1_M037.wav	01
Ses03F_script03_2_M044	 I wouldn't marry you again if you came back crawling to me on your hands and knees because you're vile. You're a mean, evil-minded little vampire and I hope to God I never set eyes on you again.	Ses03F-script03-05-01-2_M044.wav	05
Ses05M_impro08_M006	 Okay. Um-  Well, I don't know.  And it consistently happens every two weeks?	Ses05M-impro08-01-01-M006.wav	01
Ses01M_impro02_F010	 What about the birthday party?	Ses01M-impro02-04-01-F010.wav	04
Ses02F_impro04_M003	 No, come on.  Don't [GARBAGE]	Ses02F-impro04-01-01-M003.wav	01

Ses01F_script03_2_F029	 Not very funny, darling.  Why don't you have some more brandy.	Ses01F-script03-05-01-2_F029.wav	05
Ses01M_impro06_F008	 how was sick?	Ses01M-impro06-01-01-F008.wav	01
Ses05M_script01_3_M021	 Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going for me.	Ses05M-script01-04-01-3_M021.wav	04
Ses02F_impro04_M016	 Right.	Ses02F-impro04-01-01-M016.wav	01
Ses04M_script03_2_F040	 Very well, if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_F040.wav	05
Ses04F_impro07_F003	 Yes, I am.	Ses04F-impro07-07-01-F003.wav	07
Ses02M_script01_1_F036	 Tell me, you'd leave the business?	Ses02M-script01-05-01-1_F036.wav	05
Ses01M_script02_2_F030	 I want something to turn out the way that it's supposed to.	Ses01M-script02-05-01-2_F030.wav	05
Ses04M_script01_2_F007	 Now listen, kid. Now, listen.	Ses04M-script01-01-01-2_F007.wav	01
Ses03M_impro04_F015	 Well, I'm moving up.  I mean it could be...	Ses03M-impro04-01-01-F015.wav	01
Ses02F_script02_1_M024	 Think about the people in Kansas, they had to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to see this.  We live forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up.	Ses02F-script02-07-01-1_M024.wav	07
Ses04M_impro02_M000	 It's only going to be a year.	Ses04M-impro02-04-01-M000.wav	04
Ses04M_script03_2_F045	 Stop.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_F045.wav	05
Ses01F_script01_2_F005	 What is going on here, Joe?	Ses01F-script01-05-01-2_F005.wav	05
Ses03F_script02_2_F012	 Like I feel like my whole life I've been just standing on this beach with my hands clasped waiting for these fish to show up and these fish never show up.	Ses03F-script02-05-01-2_F012.wav	05
Ses03F_impro07_F028	 Yeah. I'll get like one of those little--	Ses03F-impro07-07-01-F028.wav	07
