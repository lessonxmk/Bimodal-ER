Ses01F_impro04_M010	 Hmm.	Ses01F-impro04-01-01-M010.wav	01

Ses05F_impro08_F016	 So in the database, it looks as though um, there is a there is like a glitch in the transaction where it hadn't gone through before, but I do see that you paid the, what can you tell me the amount, what was the amount?	Ses05F-impro08-01-01-F016.wav	01
Ses05F_impro08_F018	 Well you know sometimes-- just with online transactions, things happens. so um-	Ses05F-impro08-01-01-F018.wav	01
Ses01F_impro04_M015	 No.  You can- or you can just bring it in person.  But they need, generally, something to see, you know, what kind of what that you've done, what kind of--	Ses01F-impro04-01-01-M015.wav	01
Ses05F_impro08_F021	 Yeah so- That --that did go through.	Ses05F-impro08-01-01-F021.wav	01
Ses05F_impro08_F023	 Right, right, and since--yeah, since it was just a computer glitch, then that's that should be cleared up as well.  So I'm going to go ahead and try and put that into the computer.  And if for some reason you notice on your statement in a few days that you've been charged and an overdue fee, then you should just call back and we'll have that.	Ses05F-impro08-01-01-F023.wav	01
Ses01F_impro04_M020	 Okay, yeah.  I would imagine.	Ses01F-impro04-01-01-M020.wav	01

Ses05F-impro08-05-01-M005.wav	05
Ses01F_impro05_M003	 Okay.	Ses01F-impro05-01-01-M003.wav	01
Ses01F_impro05_M004	 Okay.	Ses01F-impro05-01-01-M004.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_3_M004	 What?	Ses03F-script01-01-01-3_M004.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_2_F018	 No, you've got to believe.	Ses03F-script01-04-01-2_F018.wav	04
Ses05F_impro07_F004	 No.	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-F004.wav	07
Ses01F_impro05_M009	 Yeah. Yeah, I don't see- I don't see any--	Ses01F-impro05-01-01-M009.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_3_F003	 No. I'm not sorry. It's-	Ses03F-script01-04-01-3_F003.wav	04
Ses05F_script01_2_F001	 She's been in New York three and a half years.  Why all of the sudden?	Ses05F-script01-01-01-2_F001.wav	01
Ses05F_script01_2_M002	 What did you mean? He lived next door to the girl all of his life, why wouldn't he want to see her again? Don't look at me like that, he didn't tell me any more than he told you.	Ses05F-script01-01-01-2_M002.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_3_F026	 Well then tell me what's wrong. I mean, even in your letters there's something ashamed.	Ses03F-script01-04-01-3_F026.wav	04
Ses03F_script01_3_F027	 You should tell me.	Ses03F-script01-04-01-3_F027.wav	04
Ses05F_script01_3_F008	 Well, from her point of view why else would I come?	Ses05F-script01-01-01-3_F008.wav	01
Ses05F_script01_1_F000	 What's he going to say? Maybe we should tell him before he sees it.	Ses05F-script01-04-01-1_F000.wav	04
Ses01F_impro05_M017	 this is the only track record that we have and if it's not listed here then it's probably not anywhere.	Ses01F-impro05-01-01-M017.wav	01
Ses05F_script01_1_F004	 Did you talk to him?	Ses05F-script01-04-01-1_F004.wav	04
Ses05F_script01_1_F008	 What's the meaning of that?	Ses05F-script01-04-01-1_F008.wav	04
Ses01F_impro05_M024	 We are actually not even allowed--  you know, like we don't have to give you this fifty dollars.  We don't have to do that.	Ses01F-impro05-01-01-M024.wav	01
Ses01F_impro05_M025	 It's a gift.	Ses01F-impro05-01-01-M025.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_3_M028	 I don't know where to start.	Ses03F-script01-04-01-3_M028.wav	04
Ses05F_script01_1_F031	 You marry his girl, and you're pronouncing him dead.  Now what's going to happen to your father, do you know?  I don't.	Ses05F-script01-04-01-1_F031.wav	04
Ses05F_script01_1_M000	 He saw it.	Ses05F-script01-04-01-1_M000.wav	04
Ses01F_impro05_F008	 Flight seven fourteen.	Ses01F-impro05-05-01-F008.wav	05
Ses03F_script01_3_M038	 And I came back here and it was incredible. There was no meaning in that here. The whole thing to them was a bus accident.	Ses03F-script01-04-01-3_M038.wav	04
Ses01F_impro05_F011	 Is this a joke?	Ses01F-impro05-05-01-F011.wav	05
Ses01F_impro05_F012	 Are there candid cameras?  Is this that movie? There's that show, right?  Airplane, airline.	Ses01F-impro05-05-01-F012.wav	05
Ses05F_script01_2_F016	 You've got to believe. You've got to--	Ses05F-script01-04-01-2_F016.wav	04
Ses01F_impro05_F016	 We flew in from Paris.  I've been shopping for three weeks.	Ses01F-impro05-05-01-F016.wav	05
Ses01F_impro05_F019	 If you're- if you're- if you're looking for a lawsuit, baby, you've found it.	Ses01F-impro05-05-01-F019.wav	05
Ses05F_script01_3_M023	 It's- It's mixed up with so many other things, I-	Ses05F-script01-04-01-3_M023.wav	04
Ses05F_script01_3_M026	 just about all.	Ses05F-script01-04-01-3_M026.wav	04
Ses05F_script01_3_M031	 And I got an ideal, watching them all go down.  Everything was being destroyed see and-	Ses05F-script01-04-01-3_M031.wav	04
Ses01F_impro06_F003	 That's sweet.	Ses01F-impro06-01-01-F003.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_2_F016	 Look at it. Because why, when she came here and she slept in his room, the memorial broke into pieces. Look at it, look at it, Joe.	Ses03F-script01-05-01-2_F016.wav	05
Ses01F_impro06_F009	 this woman came up and, you know, it was hers. It was her person that was there.	Ses01F-impro06-01-01-F009.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_2_M013	 Why me, above all?	Ses03F-script01-05-01-2_M013.wav	05
Ses05F_script01_1_F033	 What the hell is this?	Ses05F-script01-05-01-1_F033.wav	05
Ses01F_impro06_F019	 Yeah.	Ses01F-impro06-01-01-F019.wav	01
Ses01F_impro06_F027	 There's another one, I can't remember.	Ses01F-impro06-01-01-F027.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_2_M016	 Look at you, you're shaking.	Ses03F-script01-05-01-2_M016.wav	05
Ses03F_script02_1_M022	 I mean, don't you want to see it?	Ses03F-script02-01-01-1_M022.wav	01
Ses05F_script01_2_F012	 Laugh.  Laugh at me, but what happens the night that she goes to sleep in his bed, and his memorial breaks in pieces?	Ses05F-script01-05-01-2_F012.wav	05
Ses01F_impro06_M015	 Mmhmm.	Ses01F-impro06-01-01-M015.wav	01
Ses03F_script02_1_F000	 Fine.	Ses03F-script02-04-01-1_F000.wav	04
Ses05F_script02_1_F000	 Fine.	Ses05F-script02-01-01-1_F000.wav	01
Ses01F_impro06_F007	 So I was like wandering around before.  It takes forever to find her headstone; I always lose it. You know.	Ses01F-impro06-04-01-F007.wav	04
Ses03F_script02_2_F016	 Do you remember the last time we came here?	Ses03F-script02-04-01-2_F016.wav	04
Ses01F_impro06_F010	 Yeah.  And she was like, that's pathetic, I hope you enjoy it.	Ses01F-impro06-04-01-F010.wav	04
Ses03F_script02_2_F017	 We thought I was pregnant.	Ses03F-script02-04-01-2_F017.wav	04
Ses03F_script02_2_F024	 I don't want to remember something.	Ses03F-script02-04-01-2_F024.wav	04
Ses01F_impro06_F013	 I don't know.	Ses01F-impro06-04-01-F013.wav	04
Ses01F_impro06_F014	 At the cemetery?	Ses01F-impro06-04-01-F014.wav	04
Ses03F_script02_2_F026	 No.	Ses03F-script02-04-01-2_F026.wav	04
Ses03F_script02_2_F028	 No, no.	Ses03F-script02-04-01-2_F028.wav	04
Ses05F_script02_1_F011	 Not particularly.	Ses05F-script02-01-01-1_F011.wav	01
Ses05F_script02_2_M002	 It certainly is not. It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.	Ses05F-script02-01-01-2_M002.wav	01
Ses05F_script02_2_M016	 Wait a minute, I got it.	Ses05F-script02-01-01-2_M016.wav	01
Ses03F_script02_2_F040	 I didn't say that.	Ses03F-script02-04-01-2_F040.wav	04
Ses05F_script02_2_F014	 We had a bottle of champagne but no glasses and you ask me to dance so we took off our shoes and while we were dancing, you said the most intimate things right in my ears so I could feel them as much as hear them.	Ses05F-script02-04-01-2_F014.wav	04
Ses01F_impro06_M003	 You know you are welcome to stay at my house if you want to just check out for a couple days and hang out.	Ses01F-impro06-04-01-M003.wav	04
Ses03F_script02_1_M001	 Look at the night we got; couldn't be better.	Ses03F-script02-07-01-1_M001.wav	07
Ses03F_script02_1_M002	 You know actually, I wanted to go a little further up the coast to get away from all the, the people and the lights, and uh- but I thought we'd miss it. Hey, how you doing?	Ses03F-script02-07-01-1_M002.wav	07
Ses05F_script02_2_F030	 For heaven's sake Augie, wherever I am I always wanted to be with you.	Ses05F-script02-04-01-2_F030.wav	04
Ses03F_script02_1_M004	 Oh, though if I can't tell it probably isn't them, right? It probably would be unmistakable, wouldn't you think? Hey, how you doing?	Ses03F-script02-07-01-1_M004.wav	07
Ses05F_script02_2_F032	 Whatever I am doing, I wanted to be with you.  I mean you are probably the one who wishes you were with somebody else, somebody who didn't take everything so hard and who knows how to enjoy herself.	Ses05F-script02-04-01-2_F032.wav	04
Ses05F_script02_2_M031	 No, I know me either.	Ses05F-script02-04-01-2_M031.wav	04
Ses01F_impro07_F016	 I know. I made such a mess of it, the entire time.  The last three things I've done, I've ruined everything, I think. Mm-hmm.  Yeah.	Ses01F-impro07-07-01-F016.wav	07
Ses05F_script02_1_M002	 Is that--no, no no is that foam?  I can't even tell, although if I- if I can't tell, it probably isn't it?  Right It'll probably be unmistakable, but don't you think?  How you doing?	Ses05F-script02-07-01-1_M002.wav	07
Ses03F_script02_1_M016	 I wonder if they can hear us talk. Or hear the vibrations in the sand when we move.	Ses03F-script02-07-01-1_M016.wav	07
Ses03F_script02_1_M021	 No. No, no, no, that's not my point. My point is there's no point in coming down here if we just turn around and leave.	Ses03F-script02-07-01-1_M021.wav	07
Ses01F_impro07_M007	 I am just- Yeah.  I'm sticking around, I'm just doing my thing.  I'm living here.  I'm so glad you're going to stay, I'm so glad you're going to be here. Yeah. Woo.	Ses01F-impro07-07-01-M007.wav	07
Ses05F_script02_1_M019	 Think about people in Kansas, they have to get a- a plane reservation and a hotel reservation just to see this uh- but we are just forty minutes away.  Too good to pass up.	Ses05F-script02-07-01-1_M019.wav	07
Ses05F_script02_1_M020	 Yeah but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives, all that flopping around is laying eggs or what you- mating or spawning or something like that.	Ses05F-script02-07-01-1_M020.wav	07
Ses03F_script03_1_F000	 [BREATHING]	Ses03F-script03-01-01-1_F000.wav	01
Ses01F_impro07_M015	 You have to get married.  Well you are married to Chuck.  You're Mrs. Nash.  Not to be confused with Mrs. Dash which is the popular seasoning.	Ses01F-impro07-07-01-M015.wav	07

Ses05F_script02_1_M033	 They are swimming right now as if it's the only thing that matters.  It's- It's single mindedness with no mind, urgency that's pure urge. It's- They don't know what drives them.  They- They don't give any name or ask any question. They just turn as one and started to swim to the very point we are standing right now for a massive celebration of sex and death.  God, it's giving me goose bumps all over my hairs on my arm. popping up.	Ses05F-script02-07-01-1_M033.wav	07

Ses05F_script03_2_F005	 And what of it?	Ses05F-script03-01-01-2_F005.wav	01
Ses01F_script01_2_M008	 How do you know why she waited?	Ses01F-script01-01-01-2_M008.wav	01
Ses01F_script01_3_F000	 You're the only one who still loves his parents.	Ses01F-script01-01-01-3_F000.wav	01
Ses03F_script03_2_M000	 As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.	Ses03F-script03-05-01-2_M000.wav	05
Ses01F_script01_3_F002	 [BREATHING] You know, it's lovely here.  The air is sweet.	Ses01F-script01-01-01-3_F002.wav	01

Ses03F_script03_2_M014	 You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want some yourself at the moment.	Ses03F-script03-05-01-2_M014.wav	05
Ses05F_script03_2_F020	 They sting.	Ses05F-script03-05-01-2_F020.wav	05

Ses01F_script01_3_F022	 Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.	Ses01F-script01-01-01-3_F022.wav	01
Ses03F_script03_2_M028	 You had a riotous-must have had a riotous time. No restraint at all. Very enjoyable. You never had much anyhow.	Ses03F-script03-05-01-2_M028.wav	05
Ses01F_script01_3_M000	 I know.  It kind of went out of style, didn't it?	Ses01F-script01-01-01-3_M000.wav	01
Ses03F_script03_2_M030	 Okay. As I mentioned before, I said I had three very minute liquor glasses. That's hardly enough to get a child of two drunk.	Ses03F-script03-05-01-2_M030.wav	05
Ses03F_script03_2_M034	 Well, I suppose the people downstairs then.	Ses03F-script03-05-01-2_M034.wav	05

Ses03F_script03_2_M044	 I wouldn't marry you again if you came back crawling to me on your hands and knees because you're vile. You're a mean, evil-minded little vampire and I hope to God I never set eyes on you again.	Ses03F-script03-05-01-2_M044.wav	05
Ses03F_script03_1_F019	 Thank you, dear. The same applies to you. Except that if I ever so much as catch you looking at another woman I'll kill you.	Ses03F-script03-07-01-1_F019.wav	07
Ses01F_script01_3_M025	 It's just all mixed up with so many other things, you know?  You know overseas I was in command of a company?	Ses01F-script01-04-01-3_M025.wav	04
Ses01F_script01_3_M026	 Well I lost them.	Ses01F-script01-04-01-3_M026.wav	04

Ses01F_script01_3_M030	 They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that, exactly.  Just a little more selfish and they would all be here today.	Ses01F-script01-04-01-3_M030.wav	04
Ses03F_script03_1_M027	 That was a rouser, wasn't it?	Ses03F-script03-07-01-1_M027.wav	07
Ses05F_script03_2_M022	 They snap.	Ses05F-script03-05-01-2_M022.wav	05

Ses01F_script01_2_F007	 Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men, why is she still single?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she waited.	Ses01F-script01-05-01-2_F007.wav	05
Ses01F_script01_2_F008	 Because she knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my darkest moments, I think of her waiting and I know that I'm right.	Ses01F-script01-05-01-2_F008.wav	05
Ses03M_impro02_M013	 We'll have internet set up, we'll get web cameras and everything.  My whole family's here too.	Ses03M-impro02-01-01-M013.wav	01

Ses01F_script02_1_M024	 Honey, this is like a natural phenomenon. I mean... People in Kansas would have to get plane reservations and get hotel rooms to see this.  It's just forty minutes away for us; it's too good to pass up.	Ses01F-script02-01-01-1_M024.wav	01
Ses03M_impro02_M004	 They want to deploy me next week.	Ses03M-impro02-04-01-M004.wav	04
Ses01F_script02_1_M029	 There's like mystery here, there's magic.  It's like a little bit of the unexplainable.  I just can't see how you're not interested.	Ses01F-script02-01-01-1_M029.wav	01
Ses03M_impro02_M006	 They said anywhere from two to three years.	Ses03M-impro02-04-01-M006.wav	04

Ses03M_script01_1_M040	 The business doesn't inspire me.	Ses03M-script01-05-01-1_M040.wav	05

Ses03M_script01_2_F015	 Laugh, laugh at me but I will.  Because you know what happened when she came here?  When she came back she slept in his room, the memorial broke into pieces. Joe, look. Look at it. You got to believe with me.	Ses03M-script01-05-01-2_F015.wav	05
Ses03M_script01_2_M015	 Wait, what does that mean?  Me above all?	Ses03M-script01-05-01-2_M015.wav	05
Ses03M_script01_2_M016	 Look at you, you're shaking.	Ses03M-script01-05-01-2_M016.wav	05

Ses05M_script02_2_F015	 Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle.	Ses05M-script02-04-01-2_F015.wav	04
Ses05M_script02_2_F016	 I would rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for something.	Ses05M-script02-04-01-2_F016.wav	04
Ses01M_impro07_M018	 I just got into it. I just kind of fell into it. Literally I was walking around and...	Ses01M-impro07-07-01-M018.wav	07
Ses05M_script02_2_F018	 No.	Ses05M-script02-04-01-2_F018.wav	04
Ses05M_script02_2_F022	 No.	Ses05M-script02-04-01-2_F022.wav	04
Ses03M_script02_2_F018	 We thought I was pregnant.	Ses03M-script02-04-01-2_F018.wav	04
Ses01M_script01_1_M017	 I'm going to ask her to marry me.	Ses01M-script01-01-01-1_M017.wav	01
Ses01M_script01_2_M000	 Well, maybe he wanted see her.	Ses01M-script01-01-01-2_M000.wav	01

Ses01M_script01_3_F004	 For one thing your mother as much as told me to go.	Ses01M-script01-01-01-3_F004.wav	01
Ses05M_script02_2_M025	 Do you think that I thought there would be times when you would look at me like I was used Kleenex or I would look at you and think, good God, when's the next flight to Alaska?  No.  No, I'm just like you. I thought it would all be like peaches and roses, and sand in our toes, and wind in our hair, and the fish would always come.  And the bills would magically pay themselves.  And we'd have three fat rosy kids.  But, ha ha, baby, the jokes on us!	Ses05M-script02-05-01-2_M025.wav	05
Ses01M_script01_1_F005	 Cried hard?	Ses01M-script01-04-01-1_F005.wav	04
Ses03M_script02_2_F009	 Okay.  Twice is as many times as we've tried and that's ever.	Ses03M-script02-05-01-2_F009.wav	05
Ses05M_script02_1_M002	 This is great.  How are you doing?  Oh, no.  Oh, do you know what I did?  I forgot the flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I forgot the flashlight.	Ses05M-script02-07-01-1_M002.wav	07
Ses03M_script02_2_M028	 Welcome to the human race.	Ses03M-script02-05-01-2_M028.wav	05
Ses03M_script02_2_M029	 Do you think that this is what I had in mind?  That four years down the line that we'd get married and come to the beach and argue with each other over fish?  No.	Ses03M-script02-05-01-2_M029.wav	05
Ses03M_script02_2_M030	 I was just like you.  I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and everything great and the sand in our toes and the wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'd have three big fat rosy kids...	Ses03M-script02-05-01-2_M030.wav	05
Ses05M_script02_1_M009	 Oh, I wonder if they can hear me or if they can feel the vibrations when we move around in the sand. or something	Ses05M-script02-07-01-1_M009.wav	07
Ses01M_script01_1_M042	 No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.	Ses01M-script01-04-01-1_M042.wav	04
Ses05M_script02_1_M021	 I mean, this is a big night for these guys.  You know, life's last orgy.	Ses05M-script02-07-01-1_M021.wav	07
Ses01M_script01_3_F021	 You got to tell me.	Ses01M-script01-04-01-3_F021.wav	04
Ses01M_script01_3_F022	 Wouldn't work like this.	Ses01M-script01-04-01-3_F022.wav	04
Ses03M_script02_1_M004	 But if I can't tell, it probably isn't them isn't it?  Probably would be unmistakable wouldn't you think?  How are you doing?	Ses03M-script02-07-01-1_M004.wav	07
Ses01M_script01_3_F026	 Do you still feel that way?	Ses01M-script01-04-01-3_F026.wav	04
Ses03M_script02_1_M023	 Honey, this is a natural phenomenon.  It only happens once a year.  I mean think about the people in Kansas, they would have to get hotel reservations and plane tickets to come and see this.  We're only forty minutes away.  This is too good to pass up.	Ses03M-script02-07-01-1_M023.wav	07
Ses03M_script02_1_M025	 But this is the big night for these guys.  Their last, life's last orgy.	Ses03M-script02-07-01-1_M025.wav	07
Ses05M_script03_1_F012	 Who's they?	Ses05M-script03-01-01-1_F012.wav	01
Ses05M_script03_1_F013	 If I laugh at everything, then I must laugh at us too.	Ses05M-script03-01-01-1_F013.wav	01
Ses03M_script02_1_M034	 Look, is that...no is that just seaweed?	Ses03M-script02-07-01-1_M034.wav	07
Ses05M_script03_1_M003	 We're all right, aren't we, darling, whatever happens?	Ses05M-script03-01-01-1_M003.wav	01
Ses03M_script02_1_M040	 They just start swimming to this place right here where we stand for massive celebration of sex and death.	Ses03M-script02-07-01-1_M040.wav	07
Ses01M_script01_3_M030	 He just put it in my pocket that's the kind of guys I had.	Ses01M-script01-04-01-3_M030.wav	04
Ses01M_script01_3_M031	 They didn't die they killed themselves for each other and I mean that exactly, you know a little more selfish and they'll all be here today...	Ses01M-script01-04-01-3_M031.wav	04
Ses03M_script02_1_M042	 [BREATHING] So what do you think?	Ses03M-script02-07-01-1_M042.wav	07
Ses01M_script01_3_M034	 I thought I would change everything you know, and I got back here and it was- it was like nothing had changed at all...	Ses01M-script01-04-01-3_M034.wav	04
Ses01M_script01_3_M036	 And no one had changed it was just like sort of random bus accident to them.	Ses01M-script01-04-01-3_M036.wav	04
Ses03M_script03_2_F012	 It's become a habit with you.	Ses03M-script03-01-01-2_F012.wav	01
Ses05M_script03_2_M011	 I think I'll have a little.	Ses05M-script03-01-01-2_M011.wav	01
Ses01M_script01_3_M041	 I want you to know Annie.	Ses01M-script01-04-01-3_M041.wav	04
Ses05M_script03_2_F018	 No, it it is not, be quiet.	Ses05M-script03-05-01-2_F018.wav	05
Ses05M_script03_2_F035	 You are far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.	Ses05M-script03-05-01-2_F035.wav	05
Ses01M_script01_1_F017	 Why?	Ses01M-script01-05-01-1_F017.wav	05
Ses03M_script03_2_F001	 Presents?  A trivial little broach.	Ses03M-script03-05-01-2_F001.wav	05
Ses03M_script03_2_F011	 I don't see what you have to go on and on with this kind of thing.	Ses03M-script03-05-01-2_F011.wav	05
Ses03M_script03_2_F014	 What?	Ses03M-script03-05-01-2_F014.wav	05
Ses03M_script03_2_F024	 Adders don't snap, they sting.	Ses03M-script03-05-01-2_F024.wav	05

Ses03M_script03_2_F028	 Mind your business.	Ses03M-script03-05-01-2_F028.wav	05
Ses03M_script03_2_F030	 You've always had a weak head.	Ses03M-script03-05-01-2_F030.wav	05

Ses01M_script01_1_M035	 Yes, yes I like it for one hour a day.  I don't care if I have to grub for money all day long when I come home I want it nice, I want a family, I want to kids and Annie is in the center of that.	Ses01M-script01-05-01-1_M035.wav	05
Ses03M_script03_2_F042	 This is the end.  Understand?  This is the end, here and now, forever and always.	Ses03M-script03-05-01-2_F042.wav	05
Ses05M_script03_2_M030	 You know, we could get a really good debate going on about this.  You know intemperate tots.	Ses05M-script03-05-01-2_M030.wav	05
Ses05M_script03_2_M034	 Well, there are people downstairs, I suppose.	Ses05M-script03-05-01-2_M034.wav	05
Ses03M_script03_2_M004	 You must admit he was in love with you.	Ses03M-script03-05-01-2_M004.wav	05
Ses03M_script03_2_M005	 You let him kiss you. You said so.  What of it?	Ses03M-script03-05-01-2_M005.wav	05
Ses01M_script01_2_F011	 Oh, laugh at me, laugh all you like but why does this happen to very night she comes back?  She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look at it, Joe look.	Ses01M-script01-05-01-2_F011.wav	05
Ses01M_script01_2_F013	 You above all have got to believe. Just don't stop believing.	Ses01M-script01-05-01-2_F013.wav	05
Ses05M_script03_2_M040	 Ja! Very funny.	Ses05M-script03-05-01-2_M040.wav	05

Ses03M_script03_2_M014	 You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want any yourself at the moment.	Ses03M-script03-05-01-2_M014.wav	05
Ses05M_script03_2_M041	 You are a vile tempered, wicked living, evil little beast.  And I hope I never set eyes on you ever again.	Ses05M-script03-05-01-2_M041.wav	05
Ses05M_script03_1_F001	 what, Nobody knows we are here except Freda and she wouldn't ring up.	Ses05M-script03-07-01-1_F001.wav	07
Ses01M_script02_1_M007	 Flashlight the silver one.  There's only one isn't there?	Ses01M-script02-01-01-1_M007.wav	01

Ses01M_script02_2_M019	 you were fine during the phone call from Marge, dinner was okay, doing the dishes was fine.	Ses01M-script02-01-01-2_M019.wav	01
Ses04F_impro01_F004	 I did exactly what they told me to do.	Ses04F-impro01-05-01-F004.wav	05
Ses01M_script02_2_M021	 So I'm putting the animals out we're getting the car to the garage and--	Ses01M-script02-01-01-2_M021.wav	01
Ses01M_script02_2_M022	 Wait a minute, I've got it.	Ses01M-script02-01-01-2_M022.wav	01
Ses01M_script02_2_M023	 It was when we were driving passed that knickerbocker liquor locker and you would said, no you said "let's get some champagne" and I said "no time to wasting" or something like that.  That's what it is, right?	Ses01M-script02-01-01-2_M023.wav	01
Ses04F_impro01_F010	 Okay.  Well, I can do that right here right now without going to the back of the line again.  See look initialed.  All done. Ready to go.	Ses04F-impro01-05-01-F010.wav	05
Ses05M_script03_1_M022	 So is everyone else in the long run.  Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as long as we can, like little quiet idiotic school children.	Ses05M-script03-07-01-1_M022.wav	07
Ses01M_script02_2_M028	 Do you want to take off our shoes?	Ses01M-script02-01-01-2_M028.wav	01
Ses01M_script02_2_M050	 It's not champagne.	Ses01M-script02-01-01-2_M050.wav	01
Ses01M_script02_2_M054	 Or not.	Ses01M-script02-01-01-2_M054.wav	01
Ses01M_script02_2_F024	 I'd rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for some things.	Ses01M-script02-04-01-2_F024.wav	04

Ses04F_impro02_F005	 Well you have to have faith because I don't have a choice and I have to go.	Ses04F-impro02-04-01-F005.wav	04
Ses01M_script02_2_F040	 You are the one who probably wishes he was with somebody else, someone who didn't take everything so seriously, someone who would enjoy yourself.	Ses01M-script02-04-01-2_F040.wav	04
Ses04F_impro02_F011	 What's that supposed to mean?	Ses04F-impro02-04-01-F011.wav	04
Ses01M_script02_2_M038	 No.  You know what you get?  You know what you get?  You get this.	Ses01M-script02-04-01-2_M038.wav	04

Ses04F_impro02_M004	 And, uh, I'm afraid that if you, you know, when you leave, you won't come back.	Ses04F-impro02-04-01-M004.wav	04
Ses04F_impro02_F017	 Thanks that helps.	Ses04F-impro02-05-01-F017.wav	05

Ses01M_script02_1_M028	 People in Kansas would have to get plane tickets and make hotel reservations to see this.  It's only forty minutes away; it's just too good to pass up.	Ses01M-script02-05-01-1_M028.wav	05
Ses01M_script02_2_F014	 Twice is every year we've tried that's ever.	Ses01M-script02-05-01-2_F014.wav	05
Ses01M_script02_2_F015	 No we won't.  It's pointless it's like a waiting up to see Santa Claus.	Ses01M-script02-05-01-2_F015.wav	05
Ses01M_script02_2_M033	 A new carpet, a poodle, a suicide pact, ice cream, a back rub, what?  What?  What the hell do you want?	Ses01M-script02-05-01-2_M033.wav	05
Ses01M_script02_1_M000	 What time is it?  God, this is great, isn't it?  I can't believe it.	Ses01M-script02-07-01-1_M000.wav	07
Ses04F_impro03_M030	 Greens and blues and maybe a little light yellow?	Ses04F-impro03-01-01-M030.wav	01
Ses04F_impro03_M033	 I mean, you know, you're going to have at least, like, two hundred and fifty people come.  So we're going to need, you know, just a huge buffet.	Ses04F-impro03-01-01-M033.wav	01
Ses04F_impro03_F005	 Thank you. [LAUGHTER]	Ses04F-impro03-07-01-F005.wav	07
Ses01M_script02_1_M044	 And form the line and started swimming, swimming that would bring them to this point here...	Ses01M-script02-07-01-1_M044.wav	07
Ses01M_script02_1_M046	 It's crazy.  Look at this, I'm giving myself goose bumps, the hairs are standing up on my arm.	Ses01M-script02-07-01-1_M046.wav	07
Ses01M_script02_2_M001	 ...to this spot for this massive celebration of like sex and death...	Ses01M-script02-07-01-2_M001.wav	07
Ses01M_script03_2_F006	 Well, what of it?	Ses01M-script03-01-01-2_F006.wav	01
Ses04F_impro03_F015	 plan everything.  So then you can make sure that no one gets attacked by bears.	Ses04F-impro03-07-01-F015.wav	07
Ses01M_script03_2_M012	 I'll have a little, I think.	Ses01M-script03-01-01-2_M012.wav	01
Ses04F_impro03_F018	 Okay.  It's going to be in, like, six months.  So we don't have a really long time.	Ses04F-impro03-07-01-F018.wav	07
Ses04F_impro03_F034	 Throw in a little- little, uh, trim in yellow.  Maybe some yellow flowers.	Ses04F-impro03-07-01-F034.wav	07
Ses01M_script03_2_F023	 I don't care.  I don't care, do you understand?  I don't mind if they bark and they roll about like hoops.	Ses01M-script03-05-01-2_F023.wav	05
Ses01M_script03_2_F024	 Yes, I did quite a lot.	Ses01M-script03-05-01-2_F024.wav	05
Ses04F_impro03_F043	 I know.  I've been waiting forever.  I can't believe it's finally happening.	Ses04F-impro03-07-01-F043.wav	07
Ses01M_script03_2_F026	 You're quite insufferable, I expect it's because you're drunk.	Ses01M-script03-05-01-2_F026.wav	05
Ses04F_impro03_F044	 You don't look like you're going to faint.	Ses04F-impro03-07-01-F044.wav	07
Ses01M_script03_2_F028	 On the contrary, a child two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.	Ses01M-script03-05-01-2_F028.wav	05
Ses01M_script03_2_F029	 Shut up.	Ses01M-script03-05-01-2_F029.wav	05

You can't just give me fifty dollar gift certificate to Percoes or whatever the hell and then send me off like that's- that's good enough.  Like that's all I needed was fifty dollars.  My bag is worth more than that.	Ses04F-impro05-05-01-F011.wav	05

Ses04F_script01_3_M034	 And I got this idea watching them go down.  Everything was being destroyed see, but it seemed to me that there was one new thing that was made	Ses04F-script01-04-01-3_M034.wav	04

Ses02F_script02_1_F019	 We didn't see them the first time either.	Ses02F-script02-01-01-1_F019.wav	01
Ses04F_script02_2_F009	 For heaven's sake, grow up we are not going to see the Grunions.	Ses04F-script02-05-01-2_F009.wav	05
Ses02F_script02_1_M010	 Right, of course.  Our flashlight.  Mine and yours.  I mean, me flashlight is su flashlight naturally.	Ses02F-script02-01-01-1_M010.wav	01
Ses02F_script02_1_M021	 No. No. That's not my point.  The point is there's no point in coming down if we just leave.  Don't you want to see it?	Ses02F-script02-01-01-1_M021.wav	01
Ses04F_script02_1_M009	 I hope the moon stays out.  I wonder do they always run during a full moon.  I can't remember if it was full last year.  Remember?	Ses04F-script02-07-01-1_M009.wav	07
Ses02F_script02_1_M043	 Well, so what do you think?	Ses02F-script02-01-01-1_M043.wav	01
Ses02F_script02_1_M044	 What I was saying.	Ses02F-script02-01-01-1_M044.wav	01
Ses02F_script02_2_F000	 About what?	Ses02F-script02-01-01-2_F000.wav	01
Ses04F_script02_1_M033	 Ah, man this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for anything.  I mean think about this.  I know you're not interested but just think about this for a minute.	Ses04F-script02-07-01-1_M033.wav	07
Ses04F_script02_1_M037	 It's single mindedness with no mind.  Urgency that's pure urge.	Ses04F-script02-07-01-1_M037.wav	07
Ses02F_script02_2_M013	 It's just fish.  Nothing to get traumatized about.	Ses02F-script02-01-01-2_M013.wav	01
Ses04F_script02_2_M046	 Well look at what we got here.	Ses04F-script02-07-01-2_M046.wav	07
Ses02F_script02_2_M017	 Okay, so I'm putting on my jacket, putting out the animals, getting the car out of the garage--	Ses02F-script02-01-01-2_M017.wav	01
Ses02F_script02_2_M018	 Wait a minute.  I've got it.	Ses02F-script02-01-01-2_M018.wav	01
Ses02F_script02_2_M022	 You want me to go get some champagne?	Ses02F-script02-01-01-2_M022.wav	01
Ses02F_script02_2_M023	 Take off our shoes?	Ses02F-script02-01-01-2_M023.wav	01
Ses04F_script03_1_M029	 Horrible thing.  I hated it.	Ses04F-script03-01-01-1_M029.wav	01
Ses02F_script02_2_M034	 Right.	Ses02F-script02-01-01-2_M034.wav	01
Ses02F_script02_2_F016	 I thought I was pregnant, you had a bottle of champagne, but no glasses.  You asked me to dance, so we kicked off our shoes and you popped the cork.	Ses02F-script02-04-01-2_F016.wav	04
Ses04F_script03_2_M010	 I'll have some myself, I think.	Ses04F-script03-01-01-2_M010.wav	01
Ses02F_script02_2_F018	 And I remember thinking, this is it.  You know, at last--at last I am as happy as I am supposed to be.	Ses02F-script02-04-01-2_F018.wav	04
Ses04F_script03_2_F005	 What of it?	Ses04F-script03-05-01-2_F005.wav	05
Ses04F_script03_2_F019	 It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.	Ses04F-script03-05-01-2_F019.wav	05
Ses02F_script02_2_F024	 No.	Ses02F-script02-04-01-2_F024.wav	04
Ses04F_script03_2_F027	 On, the contrary.  A child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.	Ses04F-script03-05-01-2_F027.wav	05
Ses04F_script03_2_F031	 There is no one upstairs.  It's a photographer's studio.	Ses04F-script03-05-01-2_F031.wav	05
Ses02F_script02_2_F005	 God damn it, Augie, don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  You always ask me that.  It's insulting.	Ses02F-script02-05-01-2_F005.wav	05
Ses04F_script03_2_F036	 Go away, go away.  I hate you.	Ses04F-script03-05-01-2_F036.wav	05
Ses04F_script03_2_F038	 Stop.	Ses04F-script03-05-01-2_F038.wav	05
Ses04F_script03_2_M008	 That's a nice point of view, I must say.	Ses04F-script03-05-01-2_M008.wav	05
Ses04F_script03_2_M034	 There are people downstairs I suppose.	Ses04F-script03-05-01-2_M034.wav	05
Ses02F_script02_1_M042	 Ah, God, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  Look, all my hairs are popped up.	Ses02F-script02-07-01-1_M042.wav	07
Ses02F_script03_1_F014	 Well how long will it last us, this ludicrous overbearing love of ours.	Ses02F-script03-01-01-1_F014.wav	01
Ses04F_script03_2_M045	 You're a mean, evil minded, little tempered witch. I hope to God I never set eyes on you again as long as I live. Whore.	Ses04F-script03-05-01-2_M045.wav	05
Ses04F_script03_1_F030	 And very much sillier.	Ses04F-script03-07-01-1_F030.wav	07
Ses02F_script03_1_M021	 So is everyone else in the long run.	Ses02F-script03-01-01-1_M021.wav	01
Ses04F_script03_1_M007	 With the most perfect poise.	Ses04F-script03-07-01-1_M007.wav	07
Ses02F_script03_1_M026	 The one when you bought that little painted wooden snake in the Piazza and put it on my bed.	Ses02F-script03-01-01-1_M026.wav	01
Ses04M_impro01_F002	 Okay.  This is the wrong form.  I'm sorry.	Ses04M-impro01-01-01-F002.wav	01
Ses02F_script03_1_M031	 I didn't hit you very hard.	Ses02F-script03-01-01-1_M031.wav	01
Ses04M_impro01_F012	 twenty bucks? Please. Go get in that line over there.	Ses04M-impro01-01-01-F012.wav	01
Ses02F_script03_1_M034	 As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.	Ses02F-script03-01-01-1_M034.wav	01
Ses02F_script03_2_F007	 Well, if you hadn't been so suspicious and nosey, you never would have known a thing about it.	Ses02F-script03-01-01-2_F007.wav	01
Ses02F_script03_2_F011	 Just seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing.	Ses02F-script03-01-01-2_F011.wav	01
Ses04M_impro01_M003	 Yes, I do.	Ses04M-impro01-01-01-M003.wav	01
Ses04M_impro01_M018	 It's not rocket science.	Ses04M-impro01-05-01-M018.wav	05
Ses02F_script03_2_F018	 Oh, be quiet.	Ses02F-script03-05-01-2_F018.wav	05
Ses04M_impro03_M031	 So, um, anyway, do you want to order now?   So, um I mean--	Ses04M-impro03-01-01-M031.wav	01
Ses04M_impro03_F011	 Are you going to get married like on the beach barefoot or like fancier?  Like in a church.	Ses04M-impro03-07-01-F011.wav	07
Ses02F_script03_2_F042	 I am.  Let go of me.  You're a cruel fiend and I hate and loathe you.	Ses02F-script03-05-01-2_F042.wav	05
Ses02F_script03_2_F043	 Thank God I realized what you are-- I'd never marry you again ever in my life. You're a cruel fiend and I hate you. You're a beast. You're a beast--I hate you. Stop it.  Stop it.	Ses02F-script03-05-01-2_F043.wav	05
Ses02F_script03_2_M006	 What of it?	Ses02F-script03-05-01-2_M006.wav	05
Ses04M_impro03_F025	 All fruit and brown. [LAUGHTER]	Ses04M-impro03-07-01-F025.wav	07
Ses04M_impro03_M017	 Yeah.  But I'm really excited.  So and everybody's going to come out and it'll be a great time.  And--	Ses04M-impro03-07-01-M017.wav	07
Ses02F_script03_2_M043	 You're not.	Ses02F-script03-05-01-2_M043.wav	05
Ses02F_script03_2_M045	 I wouldn't-- I wouldn't marry--	Ses02F-script03-05-01-2_M045.wav	05
Ses04M_impro04_F004	 I mean, you have to be really aggressive about it.	Ses04M-impro04-01-01-F004.wav	01
Ses04M_impro04_F005	 Well, I mean, if it's that bad, maybe you're gonna have to take something that doesn't really fit, you know.  Like maybe you'll have to do something else for a while.  Find a new field, new skill.	Ses04M-impro04-01-01-F005.wav	01
Ses04M_impro04_F007	 If you're not willing to try and work with it and find something and, you know, I mean, there are things you could do.	Ses04M-impro04-01-01-F007.wav	01
Ses04M_impro04_F008	 Well maybe, you know, your luck it is just down and the market for your particular field is down and maybe you just need to look into doing something else for a while.	Ses04M-impro04-01-01-F008.wav	01
Ses04M_impro04_F011	 It's my fault 'cause you didn't do what I told you to?	Ses04M-impro04-01-01-F011.wav	01
Ses02M_impro01_F001	 Sure, um	Ses02M-impro01-01-01-F001.wav	01
Ses02M_impro01_F003	 I actually need two forms of ID. I need either a passport or a birth certificate, or social security card. I'm sorry.	Ses02M-impro01-01-01-F003.wav	01
Ses02M_impro01_F015	 I'm sorry, sir.	Ses02M-impro01-01-01-F015.wav	01
Ses04M_impro05_F003	 Right.	Ses04M-impro05-01-01-F003.wav	01
Ses04M_impro05_F036	 I understand you're frustrated, but--	Ses04M-impro05-01-01-F036.wav	01
Ses02M_impro01_M018	 You- shouldn't you have like a sign or something maybe like up on the counter when you get the applica- maybe on the application	Ses02M-impro01-05-01-M018.wav	05
Ses04M_impro05_F037	 I know. I understand it's personal-- It's personal to you. I get that.	Ses04M-impro05-01-01-F037.wav	01
Ses04M_impro05_M009	 fifty dollars. No way, no.	Ses04M-impro05-05-01-M009.wav	05
Ses02M_impro02_F000	 I don't want you to go.	Ses02M-impro02-04-01-F000.wav	04
Ses02M_impro02_F002	 I don't want to be a single mom.	Ses02M-impro02-04-01-F002.wav	04
Ses04M_impro05_M016	 You--	Ses04M-impro05-05-01-M016.wav	05
Ses02M_impro02_F005	 I hope so.	Ses02M-impro02-04-01-F005.wav	04
Ses02M_impro02_F006	 I hope so.	Ses02M-impro02-04-01-F006.wav	04
Ses04M_impro05_M045	 So why don't we just do that and stop this nonsense, hmm?  Hmm?	Ses04M-impro05-05-01-M045.wav	05
Ses02M_impro02_M000	 I know, I know. I don't want to go either baby. I love you know. And I'm going to miss you a lot.	Ses02M-impro02-04-01-M000.wav	04
Ses02M_impro02_M001	 You won't be. I'll be back; I'll be back before you know it. All right, and	Ses02M-impro02-04-01-M001.wav	04
Ses02M_impro02_M008	 I hope so, because I'm not going to be able to survive without all that. I don't know what I'm going to do.	Ses02M-impro02-04-01-M008.wav	04
Ses04M_impro06_F007	 How's, um -- how's his parents doing?	Ses04M-impro06-04-01-F007.wav	04
Ses02M_impro02_M018	 I want you to, you know, take lots of video; pictures and I can see you when I get back or while I'm there. I'm going to miss you.	Ses02M-impro02-04-01-M018.wav	04
Ses04M_impro06_F014	 I agree.  If I knew how to make that happen, I would certainly help you.	Ses04M-impro06-04-01-F014.wav	04
Ses04M_impro06_F017	 I know.	Ses04M-impro06-04-01-F017.wav	04

Ses02M_impro03_M000	 Oh, you're never going to believe it.	Ses02M-impro03-07-01-M000.wav	07
Ses04M_impro06_M010	 Yeah, I don't know.  Sometimes I wish I didn't know him.  So I wouldn't--	Ses04M-impro06-04-01-M010.wav	04
Ses04M_impro06_M014	 I don't know what to do.	Ses04M-impro06-04-01-M014.wav	04
Ses04M_impro06_M016	 I hope it rains.  Somehow that'll make me feel more comfortable.	Ses04M-impro06-04-01-M016.wav	04
Ses04M_impro06_M020	 I know.	Ses04M-impro06-04-01-M020.wav	04

Ses04M_impro07_F026	 Okay.  Well that's cool, too, but like--	Ses04M-impro07-01-01-F026.wav	01
Ses04M_impro07_M030	 Maybe some golf matches.	Ses04M-impro07-01-01-M030.wav	01
Ses02M_impro04_F007	 You are persistence. I mean that's important. that's	Ses02M-impro04-01-01-F007.wav	01
Ses04M_impro07_M032	 I don't know.  Do they have golf?  Do they have- Does U.S.C. have a -- I don't know if they have a golf team.	Ses04M-impro07-01-01-M032.wav	01
Ses02M_impro04_F010	 That's- I mean. There are more factors then just whether you're good or not, you know what I mean like	Ses02M-impro04-01-01-F010.wav	01
Ses04M_impro07_M036	 Forget it. Forget it. Forget it. No way.	Ses04M-impro07-01-01-M036.wav	01
Ses04M_impro07_M040	 Okay.  Um, but, no, I, uh, I do need to get a gun soon, though, 'cause I mean	Ses04M-impro07-01-01-M040.wav	01
Ses02M_impro04_F014	 You know and the fact you still here and still cooking, like it's good that you're thinking about it, that you're reconsidering.	Ses02M-impro04-01-01-F014.wav	01
Ses04M_impro07_F002	 I didn't even	Ses04M-impro07-07-01-F002.wav	07
Ses02M_impro04_M019	 this doesn't happen to a normal person.	Ses02M-impro04-05-01-M019.wav	05
Ses02M_impro05_F000	 Hi, can I help you?	Ses02M-impro05-01-01-F000.wav	01
Ses02M_impro05_F002	 Okay. Well, um- the f.	Ses02M-impro05-01-01-F002.wav	01
Ses02M_impro05_F004	 Well, you can fill out this paperwork um- and if for some reason it shows up, we can bring it to you, but-	Ses02M-impro05-01-01-F004.wav	01
Ses04M_impro07_F017	 Well congratulations.	Ses04M-impro07-07-01-F017.wav	07
Ses04M_impro07_M000	 Alright, so you're not going to believe this.  But I went home today. I looked through the mail.  And I got an acceptance letter from U.S.C..	Ses04M-impro07-07-01-M000.wav	07
Ses04M_impro07_M001	 I'm going to U.S.C.. Yeah.	Ses04M-impro07-07-01-M001.wav	07
Ses04M_impro07_M002	 Yeah, yeah.	Ses04M-impro07-07-01-M002.wav	07
Ses04M_impro07_M014	 Um, but, uh- anyway -- yeah, so that's awesome, though, because you live here and then we're not going to be separated by me going to some other school	Ses04M-impro07-07-01-M014.wav	07
Ses02M_impro05_F020	 all right, We've already checked back here for your baggage	Ses02M-impro05-01-01-F020.wav	01
Ses02M_impro05_F023	 Well, it's- it's just sort of help with the fact uh that you lost some of your possessions and we rather do that than-	Ses02M-impro05-01-01-F023.wav	01
Ses02M_impro05_F025	 Well because lots of people get their baggage lost and we don't want to have false claims or anything like that so we have	Ses02M-impro05-01-01-F025.wav	01
Ses02M_impro05_F026	 we can give you fifty dollar to sort of make up for it, to compensate, and we can definitely let you know if it shows up but likely, more than likely-	Ses02M-impro05-01-01-F026.wav	01
Ses04M_impro08_F028	 call up the Sprint call center and, uh, you know. cool	Ses04M-impro08-01-01-F028.wav	01
Ses04M_impro08_M004	 Okay.	Ses04M-impro08-01-01-M004.wav	01
Ses04M_impro08_M008	 So you're saying that you didn't make these calls.	Ses04M-impro08-01-01-M008.wav	01
Ses04M_impro08_M019	 Yeah.  That's fine.  I just -- that's fine. Yeah, I mean, it doesn't make any difference to me.  I mean, it's not like it's going to cost my job or anything.	Ses04M-impro08-01-01-M019.wav	01
Ses04M_impro08_M020	 I mean, technically, that's policy.  But, like, I mean, I don't really care about -- nobody really cares about policy here.	Ses04M-impro08-01-01-M020.wav	01
Ses04M_impro08_M021	 Sure.	Ses04M-impro08-01-01-M021.wav	01
Ses04M_impro08_M025	 Oh, I don't know.  I mean, I don't know.  I just thought, you know, maybe you want to get some co--I mean, I'm actually -- wait, where do you live?  Oh, you're in Los Angeles, I see.  Oh, no, that sucks 'cause I'm in, actually in Alabama.	Ses04M-impro08-01-01-M025.wav	01
Ses02M_impro06_F013	 Are you going to be okay?	Ses02M-impro06-04-01-F013.wav	04
Ses04M_script01_1_F015	 Why?	Ses04M-script01-01-01-1_F015.wav	01
Ses02M_impro06_F017	 Yes.	Ses02M-impro06-04-01-F017.wav	04
Ses02M_impro06_F018	 Yes.	Ses02M-impro06-04-01-F018.wav	04
Ses02M_impro06_M003	 I mean at least she was home, she wasn't in the hospital anymore,	Ses02M-impro06-04-01-M003.wav	04
Ses04M_script01_1_M032	 Yeah, let's keep going.	Ses04M-script01-01-01-1_M032.wav	01
Ses02M_impro06_M011	 Yes, I mean she cared about all of us. She was great	Ses02M-impro06-04-01-M011.wav	04
Ses04M_script01_1_F007	 He's getting just like after he died.  What's the meaning in that?	Ses04M-script01-04-01-1_F007.wav	04
Ses02M_impro06_M017	 just makes it that much harder to deal 'cause as much as you want to, you know, make her better, see her not in any pain, it's like, just I don't know, just has a mind of its own.	Ses02M-impro06-04-01-M017.wav	04
Ses04M_script01_2_F020	 I can't help it.	Ses04M-script01-04-01-2_F020.wav	04

Ses02M_script01_3_F021	 It wouldn't work this way.	Ses02M-script01-04-01-3_F021.wav	04
Ses02M_script01_3_F025	 Do you still feel that way?	Ses02M-script01-04-01-3_F025.wav	04
Ses04M_script02_1_M031	 They're swimming right now as if that's the only thing that matters.  It's single mindedness with no mind.  Urgency that's pure urge.	Ses04M-script02-07-01-1_M031.wav	07
Ses04M_script02_1_M033	 Well so what did you think?	Ses04M-script02-07-01-1_M033.wav	07

Ses04M_script03_2_F023	 Oh, be quiet.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_F023.wav	05
Ses02M_script01_1_M025	 To hell with that.	Ses02M-script01-05-01-1_M025.wav	05
Ses02M_script01_2_F006	 -She's not his girl Joe; she knows she's not.	Ses02M-script01-05-01-2_F006.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_F041	 Go away.  Go away.  I hate you.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_F041.wav	05
Ses02M_script01_3_M010	 I'm embarrassing you and I didn't want to tell it to you here.  I wanted some place we'd never been before.  A place where we'd be brand new to each other.	Ses02M-script01-07-01-3_M010.wav	07
Ses04M_script03_2_F044	 Listen, indeed.  I am sick and tired of listening to you, you damn sadistic bully.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_F044.wav	05

Ses04M_script03_2_M008	 You must admit that he was in love with you, wasn't he?	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M008.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_M012	 What about me?	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M012.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_M013	 That's a nice point of view, I must say.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M013.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_M021	 Nothing.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M021.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_M024	 As a matter of fact, that's perfectly true.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M024.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_M033	 I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more then, hmm?	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M033.wav	05
Ses02M_script02_2_F017	 And when we were dancing you said the softest most intimate things to me right into my ears so I could feel them as much as hear them	Ses02M-script02-04-01-2_F017.wav	04
Ses02M_script02_2_F018	 and I remember thinking that this is it you know. At last, at last I am as happy as I am supposed to be	Ses02M-script02-04-01-2_F018.wav	04
Ses02M_script02_2_F019	 Just dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle.	Ses02M-script02-04-01-2_F019.wav	04
Ses04M_script03_2_M038	 Very interesting.  And how about a child of four and a child of six and a child of nine?	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M038.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_M041	 You better turn that off I think.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M041.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_M043	 There are people downstairs, I suppose	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M043.wav	05
Ses02M_script02_2_F034	 I know that you meant this to be special and nice, and there's the sand and the moon and everything but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.	Ses02M-script02-04-01-2_F034.wav	04
Ses02M_script02_1_F018	 Last year you'll also remember our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat, we got into a big fight over nothing, and we didn't see the Grunions.	Ses02M-script02-05-01-1_F018.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_M053	 Shut up. Shut up.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M053.wav	05

Ses04M_script03_1_F027	 That was the first time you ever hit me.	Ses04M-script03-07-01-1_F027.wav	07
Ses02M_script02_1_M037	 Out there somewhere there is this huge mass of silver fish headed this way,	Ses02M-script02-07-01-1_M037.wav	07
Ses04M_script03_1_M021	 Let's savor the delight of the moment.  Come and kiss me, darling, before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.	Ses04M-script03-07-01-1_M021.wav	07
Ses04M_script03_1_M029	 How -- that was a rouser wasn't it?	Ses04M-script03-07-01-1_M029.wav	07

Ses05F_impro04_M020	 It's the way it seems to me.  You started complaining about not being able to find a job the first day you went out and didn't find a job.  And I'm not saying like and not trying to you know put you down or anything, it's just that-	Ses05F-impro04-01-01-M020.wav	01
Ses03F_impro02_M024	 It doesn't look very good.	Ses03F-impro02-04-01-M024.wav	04
Ses05F_impro04_M022	 Well, exactly.  Money is not everything.	Ses05F-impro04-01-01-M022.wav	01
Ses05F_impro04_M027	 And you've got to think--well, ask yourself why are they not hiring you?	Ses05F-impro04-01-01-M027.wav	01
Ses05F_impro04_M032	 Have you ever called them back and asked why you didn't get the job?	Ses05F-impro04-01-01-M032.wav	01

Ses05F_impro04_F019	 I'm just worried.	Ses05F-impro04-04-01-F019.wav	04
Ses05F_impro04_F042	 Would you be willing to make some more calls on my behalf? I won't--I won't make you look bad.	Ses05F-impro04-04-01-F042.wav	04
Ses05F_impro04_F008	 I still can't live on in six seven and five.  It's not possible in Los Angeles.  Housing is too expensive.	Ses05F-impro04-05-01-F008.wav	05
Ses05F_impro05_F001	 Um-Seventeen. Coming from --	Ses05F-impro05-01-01-F001.wav	01

Ses03F_impro04_M007	 You don't owe me anything.	Ses03F-impro04-01-01-M007.wav	01
Ses05F_impro05_F007	 Well, I can't leave without it. I mean, Could you find out?	Ses05F-impro05-01-01-F007.wav	01
Ses05F_impro05_M001	 On what airline?	Ses05F-impro05-01-01-M001.wav	01
Ses05F_impro05_M003	 So you haven't seen your bags since Africa. You flew threw Heath Row to here.	Ses05F-impro05-01-01-M003.wav	01
Ses05F_impro05_M006	 But uh- I don't see it here in the airport yet. uh	Ses05F-impro05-01-01-M006.wav	01
Ses03F_impro04_M017	 Maybe you could start teaching. I don't know.	Ses03F-impro04-01-01-M017.wav	01

Ses03F_impro04_M019	 Close to thirty. Oof, it's going to be tough.	Ses03F-impro04-01-01-M019.wav	01

Ses05F_impro05_M009	 Well, as I told you, it left Heath Row and it seems to have arrived here.  But if you can't find it, then-are you sure you know what your bag looks like?	Ses05F-impro05-01-01-M009.wav	01
Ses05F_impro05_M015	 Sentimental value.	Ses05F-impro05-01-01-M015.wav	01
Ses03F_impro05_M011	 I think that's kind of stupid, that you put a hundred thousands of dollars in the bag.	Ses03F-impro05-01-01-M011.wav	01
Ses05F_impro05_M022	 Let's- Let's just relax for a moment, ma'am.  You understand, obviously, we're going to do everything we can to keep all of your luggage here.	Ses05F-impro05-01-01-M022.wav	01
Ses03F_impro05_M014	 What, do you have questions?	Ses03F-impro05-01-01-M014.wav	01
Ses05F_impro05_M031	 Well, my hands are really tied then.	Ses05F-impro05-01-01-M031.wav	01
Ses03F_impro05_F007	 What do you mean, if it shows up? No, I need it now. I have my keys, I have my wallet, I have my money. I have thousands and thousands of dollars worth of stuff in there.	Ses03F-impro05-05-01-F007.wav	05
Ses05F_impro05_M034	 Uh, so it was really heavy.	Ses05F-impro05-01-01-M034.wav	01

Ses03F_impro06_F000	 Okay.	Ses03F-impro06-04-01-F000.wav	04
Ses03F_impro06_F005	 They thought he got--would get better and he did, and then it just- things turned bad.	Ses03F-impro06-04-01-F005.wav	04
Ses05F_impro05_F021	 Yeah, meaning I didn't die in a fiery plane crash.  How convenient, but um- I paid two thousand dollar to ride your airline, and I would really appreciate getting my bags there to my destination in one place.	Ses05F-impro05-05-01-F021.wav	05
Ses03F_impro06_F008	 I loved that boy.	Ses03F-impro06-04-01-F008.wav	04
Ses03F_impro06_F009	 We did everything together, you know.	Ses03F-impro06-04-01-F009.wav	04

Ses05F_impro06_M022	 Do you know what, it's going to pass,eventually, I mean it'll never pass, it'll always be there, and you'll always remember and everything like that, but you know.  It'll get easier I guess.	Ses05F-impro06-01-01-M022.wav	01
Ses05F_impro06_M023	 That's the best way to put it.	Ses05F-impro06-01-01-M023.wav	01
Ses03F_impro06_F023	 He was like, he was like my brother, you know.	Ses03F-impro06-04-01-F023.wav	04
Ses03F_impro06_F025	 Just seems so unfair, is the way it is.	Ses03F-impro06-04-01-F025.wav	04

Ses03F_impro06_F032	 yeah.	Ses03F-impro06-04-01-F032.wav	04

Ses05F_impro06_F016	 I can't imagine what his- what his parents are going through.	Ses05F-impro06-04-01-F016.wav	04
