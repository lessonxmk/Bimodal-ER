Ses03F_impro08_F001	 I [GARBAGE]	Ses03F-impro08-01-01-F001.wav	01
Ses05F_impro07_F029	 Better than if I'd picked up and moved to Boston.	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-F029.wav	07
Ses05F_impro07_F035	 We should go apartment shop-er-hunting.	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-F035.wav	07
Ses03F_impro08_F010	 Sir, I'm very sorry, but this is the way it is.  This- We have no control over it.  It's going to take-  -but you have to be patient with us.  You can use a calling card.  We will give you a free calling card to use.	Ses03F-impro08-01-01-F010.wav	01
Ses01F_impro02_F012	 If not me then, who?	Ses01F-impro02-04-01-F012.wav	04
Ses01F_impro02_F015	 Last month--  Yeah.	Ses01F-impro02-04-01-F015.wav	04
Ses01F_impro02_F017	 We've got friends, that's why we moved here, huh?  Because there is a day care down the street.	Ses01F-impro02-04-01-F017.wav	04
Ses05F_impro07_M003	 So you're not going to leave me.	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-M003.wav	07
Ses01F_impro02_M001	 I don't understand.  You've already done so much, I don't know why do you have to go back.	Ses01F-impro02-04-01-M001.wav	04
Ses01F_impro02_M011	 Yeah.	Ses01F-impro02-04-01-M011.wav	04
Ses05F_impro07_M018	 We should try to find, like, a party spot though, like you know where there's going to be a lot of parties, where there are cool people, though.  Do you know any people that might be out there?	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-M018.wav	07
Ses03F_impro08_M011	 I- I'm going to kill myself right now.	Ses03F-impro08-05-01-M011.wav	05
Ses05F_impro07_M027	 Uh huh, it will be awesome.	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-M027.wav	07
Ses03F_script01_1_F005	 He cried hard, huh?	Ses03F-script01-01-01-1_F005.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_1_F007	 Could he-he's acting just like he did after he died, you know?	Ses03F-script01-01-01-1_F007.wav	01
Ses05F_impro07_M033	 That's a good idea.	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-M033.wav	07
Ses03F_script01_1_F045	 Tell me something.	Ses03F-script01-01-01-1_F045.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_1_F050	 I'm going to.	Ses03F-script01-01-01-1_F050.wav	01
Ses01F_impro04_M001	 Yeah.	Ses01F-impro04-01-01-M001.wav	01
Ses01F_impro04_M002	 No.  There's regular jobs on there.	Ses01F-impro04-01-01-M002.wav	01
Ses05F_impro08_F014	 Okay so, I'll just look it up and you know see what's going on, maybe we can...	Ses05F-impro08-01-01-F014.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_1_M016	 You know-you know why I asked Annie here, right?	Ses03F-script01-01-01-1_M016.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_1_M017	 You know.	Ses03F-script01-01-01-1_M017.wav	01
Ses01F_impro04_M013	 It's kind of helpful when getting a job.	Ses01F-impro04-01-01-M013.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_1_M018	 I want to ask her to marry me.	Ses03F-script01-01-01-1_M018.wav	01
Ses05F_impro08_F024	 Well I'll give you my direct line and my number so you can- you can  get directly to me.	Ses05F-impro08-01-01-F024.wav	01
Ses01F_impro04_M017	 No.  But it has an outline, you know.	Ses01F-impro04-01-01-M017.wav	01
Ses01F_impro04_M018	 I know.  Okay.  Well, um. Maybe--	Ses01F-impro04-01-01-M018.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_1_M031	 I'll find out. But then after it's all over we'll thrash it out with dad, right?	Ses03F-script01-01-01-1_M031.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_1_M036	 It just is. I-	Ses03F-script01-01-01-1_M036.wav	01
Ses05F_impro08_F028	 six four nine four	Ses05F-impro08-01-01-F028.wav	01
Ses01F_impro04_M022	 maybe get a car.	Ses01F-impro04-01-01-M022.wav	01
Ses05F_impro08_F032	 Have a good day.	Ses05F-impro08-01-01-F032.wav	01
Ses05F_impro08_M013	 Okay, great, go ahead.	Ses05F-impro08-01-01-M013.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_1_M050	 Okay. Just-	Ses03F-script01-01-01-1_M050.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_2_M001	 Well, maybe, maybe he just wanted to see her.	Ses03F-script01-01-01-2_M001.wav	01
Ses05F_impro08_M020	 Are you taking the late fee off of my account then?	Ses05F-impro08-01-01-M020.wav	01
Ses05F_impro08_M022	 Right.	Ses05F-impro08-01-01-M022.wav	01
Ses01F_impro04_F029	 Who do you think you are?	Ses01F-impro04-05-01-F029.wav	05
Ses01F_impro04_F030	 You are so high and mighty.  I just--	Ses01F-impro04-05-01-F030.wav	05
Ses05F_impro08_M007	 Like I know I paid last month, but it hasn't been paid and you charged me a late fee.	Ses05F-impro08-05-01-M007.wav	05
Ses05F_script01_1_F017	 Well I got an idea.  But what's the story?	Ses05F-script01-01-01-1_F017.wav	01
Ses01F_impro05_M003	 Okay.	Ses01F-impro05-01-01-M003.wav	01
Ses01F_impro05_M004	 Okay.	Ses01F-impro05-01-01-M004.wav	01
Ses01F_impro05_M007	 all right- okay.  And you lost your bag? Is that- that the issue?	Ses01F-impro05-01-01-M007.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_2_F021	 I can't help it.	Ses03F-script01-04-01-2_F021.wav	04
Ses05F_script01_2_M001	 Well maybe.  Maybe she just wanted to see her again.	Ses05F-script01-01-01-2_M001.wav	01
Ses05F_script01_2_M002	 What did you mean? He lived next door to the girl all of his life, why wouldn't he want to see her again? Don't look at me like that, he didn't tell me any more than he told you.	Ses05F-script01-01-01-2_M002.wav	01
Ses01F_impro05_M014	 No, no.	Ses01F-impro05-01-01-M014.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_3_F028	 But, Chris, it wouldn't work like this.	Ses03F-script01-04-01-3_F028.wav	04
Ses01F_impro05_M016	 No.  I'm just giving you money, the bag is gone.  If it's not here, I'm really sorry there is nothing I can do because...	Ses01F-impro05-01-01-M016.wav	01
Ses05F_impro07_F008	 Whoa.  What an idea.  Where would you want to live?	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-F008.wav	07
Ses05F_script01_3_M004	 What?	Ses05F-script01-01-01-3_M004.wav	01
Ses01F_impro05_M020	 I know.	Ses01F-impro05-01-01-M020.wav	01
Ses01F_impro05_M022	 Okay. Calm-	Ses01F-impro05-01-01-M022.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_3_F032	 And you still feel that way?	Ses03F-script01-04-01-3_F032.wav	04
Ses05F_script01_1_F007	 It's getting just like after Larry died, he's having dreams, he's walking around at night.	Ses05F-script01-04-01-1_F007.wav	04
Ses03F_script01_3_M028	 I don't know where to start.	Ses03F-script01-04-01-3_M028.wav	04
Ses01F_impro05_M026	 You know, the airlines can not be held responsible for every bag of luggage that comes through here.	Ses01F-impro05-01-01-M026.wav	01
Ses05F_script01_1_M003	 I don't know.  but When it cracked he ran back into the house and start to cry in the kitchen.	Ses05F-script01-04-01-1_M003.wav	04
Ses01F_impro05_M029	 Well then maybe you can just call him and he can give you more money.  But right now all I can do--	Ses01F-impro05-01-01-M029.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_3_M034	 I mean, that's-that's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had. They didn't just die. They killed themselves for each other. And I mean that exactly. A little more selfish and they'd still be here today.	Ses03F-script01-04-01-3_M034.wav	04
Ses01F_impro05_M034	 If you want, you can write a letter.  I can give you the address. Yes.  An angry--	Ses01F-impro05-01-01-M034.wav	01
Ses01F_impro05_M035	 Or you can make a phone call.  But I think a letter might be a little more-- in my impression, letters have more...	Ses01F-impro05-01-01-M035.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_3_M037	 And to show that-to bring that onto the earth like some sort of monument standing right behind us where everyone could feel it and it would make a difference to him.	Ses03F-script01-04-01-3_M037.wav	04
Ses05F_script01_2_F016	 You've got to believe. You've got to--	Ses05F-script01-04-01-2_F016.wav	04
Ses01F_impro05_F012	 Are there candid cameras?  Is this that movie? There's that show, right?  Airplane, airline.	Ses01F-impro05-05-01-F012.wav	05
Ses03F_script01_3_M040	 And I felt wrong to be alive. To drive the car, to see the new checkbook, to see the new refrigerator. I mean, you can take those things out of the war. But you got to know that when you drive that car that that came out of the love a man can have for another man. And you got to be a little bit better because of that.	Ses03F-script01-04-01-3_M040.wav	04
Ses03F_script01_3_M043	 And I guess that included you.	Ses03F-script01-04-01-3_M043.wav	04
Ses01F_impro05_F018	 Do you understand who my husband is?	Ses01F-impro05-05-01-F018.wav	05
Ses05F_script01_3_M021	 Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going from me.	Ses05F-script01-04-01-3_M021.wav	04
Ses03F_script01_1_M027	 To hell with that.	Ses03F-script01-05-01-1_M027.wav	05
Ses03F_script01_1_M045	 Yes. I like it an hour out of the day. If I have to grub for money all day long at least that evening I want it beautiful. I want a wife. I want a family. I want some kids. I want to build something I can give myself to.	Ses03F-script01-05-01-1_M045.wav	05
Ses01F_impro05_F029	 I don't think you have done everything you could do because I don't have my bag here yet.	Ses01F-impro05-05-01-F029.wav	05
Ses03F_script01_2_F015	 Don't, don't laugh at me, don't laugh at me.	Ses03F-script01-05-01-2_F015.wav	05
Ses05F_script01_3_M032	 but it seemed to me that something new was being created at the same time, a kind of responsibility, man for man.  Do you understand me?	Ses05F-script01-04-01-3_M032.wav	04
Ses03F_script01_2_M011	 All right. All right. Calm yourself.	Ses03F-script01-05-01-2_M011.wav	05
Ses01F_impro06_F009	 this woman came up and, you know, it was hers. It was her person that was there.	Ses01F-impro06-01-01-F009.wav	01
Ses01F_impro06_F016	 I brought- I brought Chuck with me. He went to Redlands, yeah, for the day.  We ran through the sprinklers.	Ses01F-impro06-01-01-F016.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_2_M014	 Huh?	Ses03F-script01-05-01-2_M014.wav	05
Ses01F_impro06_F019	 Yeah.	Ses01F-impro06-01-01-F019.wav	01
Ses05F_script01_3_M036	 And I felt what you said- ashamed somehow-because nobody had changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a whole lot of guys. and	Ses05F-script01-04-01-3_M036.wav	04
Ses03F_script02_1_M020	 Yeah, that's my point too.	Ses03F-script02-01-01-1_M020.wav	01
Ses01F_impro06_M008	 How long were you there for?	Ses01F-impro06-01-01-M008.wav	01
Ses05F_script01_2_F017	 I can't help it!	Ses05F-script01-05-01-2_F017.wav	05
Ses01F_impro06_M012	 Is it a big cemetery?	Ses01F-impro06-01-01-M012.wav	01
Ses01F_impro06_M013	 Oh, so they're like really old too, really old ones?	Ses01F-impro06-01-01-M013.wav	01
Ses05F_script01_2_M016	 What do you mean me above all?  Look at you.  You're shaking!	Ses05F-script01-05-01-2_M016.wav	05
Ses05F_script01_3_M009	 I- I -I have no imagination, that's all I know what to say, I-I'm embarrassing you. I I didn't want to tell you here.  I wanted it to be some place different, some place where we could be new to each other you know.	Ses05F-script01-07-01-3_M009.wav	07
Ses01F_impro06_M016	 So she wrote a lot of poetry?	Ses01F-impro06-01-01-M016.wav	01
Ses05F_script01_3_M010	 You feel it's wrong here, don't you- this yard, this chair?  I want you to be ready for me Annie.  I don't want to win you away from anything.	Ses05F-script01-07-01-3_M010.wav	07
Ses05F_script01_3_M039	 I I want you now, Annie.	Ses05F-script01-07-01-3_M039.wav	07
Ses03F_script02_2_F017	 We thought I was pregnant.	Ses03F-script02-04-01-2_F017.wav	04
Ses01F_impro06_F010	 Yeah.  And she was like, that's pathetic, I hope you enjoy it.	Ses01F-impro06-04-01-F010.wav	04
Ses03F_script02_2_F018	 You brought a bottle of champagne.	Ses03F-script02-04-01-2_F018.wav	04
Ses05F_script02_1_F012	 I just don't.	Ses05F-script02-01-01-1_F012.wav	01
Ses03F_script02_2_F027	 No.	Ses03F-script02-04-01-2_F027.wav	04
Ses01F_impro06_F020	 It's weird.  Whenever I go back to town, I think of her.  I mean, it's like ... I mean we grew up together and she died when we were twenty one.  And yeah.  She had cancer, she had two brain tumors.	Ses01F-impro06-04-01-F020.wav	04
Ses01F_impro06_F021	 My best friend Heather.  She's got a- we have a- we built this like little--  There's a park, Prospect Park.  And there is like a garden section of it that we set up for her.	Ses01F-impro06-04-01-F021.wav	04
Ses01F_impro06_F023	 Umm. Yeah.	Ses01F-impro06-04-01-F023.wav	04
Ses01F_impro06_F026	 Some, I guess.  She memorized this one, John Dunn, it's called, Death Be Not Proud. and-	Ses01F-impro06-04-01-F026.wav	04
Ses03F_script02_2_F005	 Augie, Goddamn it, don't ask me that. You always ask me that. Why do you ask me that? I hate it. It's insulting.	Ses03F-script02-05-01-2_F005.wav	05
Ses03F_script02_2_F012	 Like I feel like my whole life I've been just standing on this beach with my hands clasped waiting for these fish to show up and these fish never show up.	Ses03F-script02-05-01-2_F012.wav	05
Ses05F_script02_2_F028	 I mean it is just this , I mean it includes a lot and everything and you know it's the sand and it's the full moon and I just-I am sorry but I couldn't help wishing I was somewhere else.	Ses05F-script02-04-01-2_F028.wav	04
Ses01F_impro07_F004	 I don't know.  I spend so much time commuting as it is, I'd rather.	Ses01F-impro07-07-01-F004.wav	07
Ses01F_impro07_F009	 Yeah.  I'm not sure.	Ses01F-impro07-07-01-F009.wav	07
Ses01F_impro07_F012	 So I get to mold young minds. Mrs.?  That's my mother.	Ses01F-impro07-07-01-F012.wav	07
Ses05F_script02_2_M025	 What.  Welcome to the human race.	Ses05F-script02-05-01-2_M025.wav	05
Ses03F_script02_1_M013	 We should have brought the blanket. Oh, why didn't we bring the blanket? Our blanket.	Ses03F-script02-07-01-1_M013.wav	07
Ses03F_script02_1_M015	 I'm so stupid. I'm like a little kid. I-it's amazing I get out of the house with my fly zipped. Oh- [LAUGHTER].	Ses03F-script02-07-01-1_M015.wav	07
Ses01F_impro07_M003	 Oh-Yeah, I bet you're really excited. Oh.  That's what loans are for?  Right? Exactly.	Ses01F-impro07-07-01-M003.wav	07
Ses01F_impro07_M005	 This is so- I am so happy that you're going to stay.  You're not going to...We should totally throw a party.	Ses01F-impro07-07-01-M005.wav	07
Ses03F_script02_1_M038	 And they all, all as one, turned as one and formed this line as big as the California coast and started swimming this way. Swimming as if that's the only thing that matters.	Ses03F-script02-07-01-1_M038.wav	07
Ses05F_script02_1_M012	 you want my jacket?	Ses05F-script02-07-01-1_M012.wav	07

Ses03F_script03_1_M004	 We're all right, aren't we darling? Whatever happens.	Ses03F-script03-01-01-1_M004.wav	01
Ses03F_script03_2_F017	 It's a woman's job to allure the man. Watch me, won't you, a minute?	Ses03F-script03-01-01-2_F017.wav	01
Ses01F_script01_1_M002	 Four o clock this morning.  I heard a crack and I woke up and looked out.  He was standing right over there when it cracked.	Ses01F-script01-01-01-1_M002.wav	01
Ses05F_script02_1_M033	 They are swimming right now as if it's the only thing that matters.  It's- It's single mindedness with no mind, urgency that's pure urge. It's- They don't know what drives them.  They- They don't give any name or ask any question. They just turn as one and started to swim to the very point we are standing right now for a massive celebration of sex and death.  God, it's giving me goose bumps all over my hairs on my arm. popping up.	Ses05F-script02-07-01-1_M033.wav	07
Ses01F_script01_1_M007	 You know Larry is not coming back and I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?	Ses01F-script01-01-01-1_M007.wav	01
Ses03F_script03_2_M012	 No particular reason. Anyhow, they were very small ones.	Ses03F-script03-01-01-2_M012.wav	01

Ses05M_script01_2_M003	 Why do you think he's even thinking that?	Ses05M-script01-01-01-2_M003.wav	01
Ses05M_script01_3_F003	 Well, your mother, first of all, pretty much told me to leave.	Ses05M-script01-01-01-3_F003.wav	01
Ses05M_script01_3_F006	 I figured they would, your mother at least.	Ses05M-script01-01-01-3_F006.wav	01
Ses01M_impro06_F007	 Was it an accident?	Ses01M-impro06-01-01-F007.wav	01
Ses01M_impro06_F008	 how was sick?	Ses01M-impro06-01-01-F008.wav	01
Ses01M_impro06_F009	 Well, I'm confused.  He was sick or it was an accident?	Ses01M-impro06-01-01-F009.wav	01
Ses05M_script01_3_F022	 Yeah, sure.	Ses05M-script01-01-01-3_F022.wav	01
Ses05M_script01_3_M022	 I don't I don't know where to start.	Ses05M-script01-01-01-3_M022.wav	01
Ses05M_script01_1b_F000	 What's he going to say?  Maybe we ought to tell him before he sees it.	Ses05M-script01-04-01-1b_F000.wav	04
Ses05M_script01_1b_M001	 He was out here when it broke.	Ses05M-script01-04-01-1b_M001.wav	04
Ses01M_impro06_F014	 Mmhmm.	Ses01M-impro06-01-01-F014.wav	01
Ses01M_impro06_F015	 Lock	Ses01M-impro06-01-01-F015.wav	01
Ses03M_script01_1_M029	 Then I guess that's the end of it.	Ses03M-script01-01-01-1_M029.wav	01
Ses01M_impro06_F017	 The plans you make [GARBAGE].	Ses01M-impro06-01-01-F017.wav	01
Ses03M_script01_1_M031	 And then we'll thrash it out with dad right?  Mom, don't avoid me.	Ses03M-script01-01-01-1_M031.wav	01
Ses01M_impro06_F020	 It gets better.	Ses01M-impro06-01-01-F020.wav	01
Ses03M_script01_2_M004	 Who said he even thought about that?	Ses03M-script01-01-01-2_M004.wav	01
Ses05M_script01_3_F020	 You have to tell me.	Ses05M-script01-04-01-3_F020.wav	04
Ses01M_impro06_F026	 It's good that you were there.	Ses01M-impro06-01-01-F026.wav	01
Ses03M_script01_1_F005	 He cried hard?	Ses03M-script01-04-01-1_F005.wav	04
Ses01M_impro06_F028	 Are there things you wish you'd done differently?	Ses01M-impro06-01-01-F028.wav	01
Ses01M_impro06_F003	 I'm sorry to hear that.	Ses01M-impro06-04-01-F003.wav	04
Ses01M_impro06_F004	 You've been taking care of it all?	Ses01M-impro06-04-01-F004.wav	04
Ses05M_script01_3_F023	 How many?	Ses05M-script01-04-01-3_F023.wav	04
Ses05M_script01_3_M020	 No, nothing like that.	Ses05M-script01-04-01-3_M020.wav	04
Ses03M_script01_1_M003	 I don't know. But after it cracked he ran back into the house and he cried in the kitchen.	Ses03M-script01-04-01-1_M003.wav	04
Ses05M_script01_3_M025	 I lost them.	Ses05M-script01-04-01-3_M025.wav	04
Ses03M_script01_1_M005	 I could hear it right through the floor.	Ses03M-script01-04-01-1_M005.wav	04
Ses03M_script01_1_M007	 I don't know.  But I know one thing mom, we made a terrible mistake with dad.	Ses03M-script01-04-01-1_M007.wav	04
Ses03M_script01_1_M030	 But from her letters I think she's forgotten him.  I'll find out.	Ses03M-script01-04-01-1_M030.wav	04
Ses01M_impro06_M007	 He kind of didn't have anyone to take care of that for him, so--	Ses01M-impro06-04-01-M007.wav	04
Ses03M_script01_1_M036	 I've given it three years of thought and I thought that if I waited then dad would forget about Larry and then we could have a regular wedding and everything happy.	Ses03M-script01-04-01-1_M036.wav	04
Ses03M_script01_1_M046	 I am thinking like that.	Ses03M-script01-04-01-1_M046.wav	04
Ses05M_script01_3_M030	 I mean that exactly, anymore selfish -- just a little bit more selfish and they would have been here today. And it gave me an idea as I was watching them all go down.	Ses05M-script01-04-01-3_M030.wav	04
Ses05M_script01_3_M036	 I felt what you said, ashamed somehow because nobody had changed at all.	Ses05M-script01-04-01-3_M036.wav	04
Ses05M_script01_3_M040	 I want you now, Annie.	Ses05M-script01-04-01-3_M040.wav	04
Ses03M_script01_2_F017	 Look, it was just last week that Detroit, some boy came back he had been away longer than Larry, you can read it for yourself. You above all people have got to believe.	Ses03M-script01-04-01-2_F017.wav	04
Ses05M_script01_1b_M019	 Isn't it your business, too, if I tell dad and he throws a fit about it?  You have such a talent for ignoring things.	Ses05M-script01-05-01-1b_M019.wav	05
Ses01M_impro06_M015	 It's just really weird because he was really young you know and it kind of like...	Ses01M-impro06-04-01-M015.wav	04
Ses01M_impro06_M017	 So weird you know that like one days it's like you know sounds so stupid but like one day someone's here. And like next day you know they're not here and it just kind of makes you like think about like life and mortality and like that kind of stuff.  You just like used to take for granted--you know.	Ses01M-impro06-04-01-M017.wav	04
Ses03M_script01_3_F007	 you saw the way that she acted and then well, I mean, you, you were acting kind of...	Ses03M-script01-04-01-3_F007.wav	04
Ses01M_impro06_M020	 What?	Ses01M-impro06-04-01-M020.wav	04
Ses05M_script01_1_F018	 Well, what do you want me to do?  You're old enough to make- to know your own mind.	Ses05M-script01-05-01-1_F018.wav	05
Ses01M_impro06_M026	 For like eight years.	Ses01M-impro06-04-01-M026.wav	04
Ses01M_impro06_M029	 So weird,	Ses01M-impro06-04-01-M029.wav	04
Ses01M_impro07_F010	 Oh.	Ses01M-impro07-01-01-F010.wav	01
Ses03M_script01_3_M035	 And to show that and to bring that onto the earth again like some sort of monument standing right behind all of us and we could feel it and it would make a difference to him.	Ses03M-script01-04-01-3_M035.wav	04
Ses01M_impro07_F020	 Oh. That is incredible. Is it--	Ses01M-impro07-01-01-F020.wav	01
Ses03M_script01_3_M036	 And then I came here and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them was a kind of bus accident.	Ses03M-script01-04-01-3_M036.wav	04
Ses03M_script01_3_M037	 And I went to work with dad and that rat race again and I felt what you said, ashamed.  Somehow because nobody was changed at all.	Ses03M-script01-04-01-3_M037.wav	04
Ses03M_script01_3_M041	 Otherwise what you have is loot and there's blood on it.	Ses03M-script01-04-01-3_M041.wav	04
Ses05M_script01_1_M032	 I've given it three years of thought.  I hoped that if I'd waited, dad would have forgotten about it by now.  And we could have like a normal wedding and everybody happy.	Ses05M-script01-05-01-1_M032.wav	05
Ses01M_impro07_F005	 That's amazing. They pay for everything?	Ses01M-impro07-07-01-F005.wav	07
Ses01M_impro07_F007	 That is incredible. Do you get like a per diem?	Ses01M-impro07-07-01-F007.wav	07
Ses03M_script01_1_F038	 You're just going to leave the business?  You have a business here.  You can't do that.	Ses03M-script01-05-01-1_F038.wav	05
Ses03M_script01_1_M009	 You know that Larry's not coming back and I know that too.  Why we both go on letting him think that we both believe with him.	Ses03M-script01-05-01-1_M009.wav	05
Ses05M_script01_2_F005	 What's going on here, Joe?	Ses05M-script01-05-01-2_F005.wav	05
Ses05M_script01_2_M015	 What's that suppose to mean, me above all?  Look at you, you're shaking.	Ses05M-script01-05-01-2_M015.wav	05
Ses03M_script01_1_M022	 Oh see then it's just not my business. God you infuriate me sometimes.  Isn't my business too if dad throws a fit?  Huh?  God you have such a talent for ignoring things.	Ses03M-script01-05-01-1_M022.wav	05
Ses03M_script01_2_F001	 Well she's been away for three and a half years in New York and suddenly she just shows up.	Ses03M-script01-05-01-2_F001.wav	05

Ses01M_impro07_M002	 For softball.  They're going to pay me to go to school. Isn't that awesome?	Ses01M-impro07-07-01-M002.wav	07
Ses03M_script01_2_M016	 Look at you, you're shaking.	Ses03M-script01-05-01-2_M016.wav	05
Ses03M_script02_1_F005	 Yes.	Ses03M-script02-01-01-1_F005.wav	01
Ses05M_script02_2_F014	 And I remember thinking to myself, finally.  I am as happy as I am supposed to be.	Ses05M-script02-04-01-2_F014.wav	04
Ses01M_impro07_M008	 But I don't know I want to live in the housing that they give me though 'cause I think I want to you know like get like a nicer place.	Ses01M-impro07-07-01-M008.wav	07
Ses01M_impro07_M009	 Where should I move?	Ses01M-impro07-07-01-M009.wav	07
Ses01M_impro07_M010	 That's a really good idea. Or I could go to like Santa Monica. Go beach. Venice beach, yeah a little dirty though. I don't want to go to Venice beach. But - Malibu. All right.	Ses01M-impro07-07-01-M010.wav	07
Ses01M_impro07_M018	 I just got into it. I just kind of fell into it. Literally I was walking around and...	Ses01M-impro07-07-01-M018.wav	07
Ses03M_script02_2_M014	 Well, we're going to see it.	Ses03M-script02-01-01-2_M014.wav	01
Ses05M_script02_2_F015	 Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle.	Ses05M-script02-04-01-2_F015.wav	04
Ses03M_script02_2_M022	 You want this to be like the other time right?  That's it right?	Ses03M-script02-01-01-2_M022.wav	01
Ses05M_script02_2_F019	 No.	Ses05M-script02-04-01-2_F019.wav	04
Ses05M_script02_2_F027	 This is just this.  I mean, it's a lot and everything.  But it's not, you know, something else.  Am I making any sense?	Ses05M-script02-04-01-2_F027.wav	04
Ses01M_script01_1_M017	 I'm going to ask her to marry me.	Ses01M-script01-01-01-1_M017.wav	01
Ses01M_script01_2_M007	 And how do you know why she's waited.	Ses01M-script01-01-01-2_M007.wav	01
Ses03M_script02_2_F036	 I can't help thinking about being somewhere else.	Ses03M-script02-04-01-2_F036.wav	04
Ses05M_script02_2_F032	 Yes.  Don't you know that? I mean, You're probably the one you wishes you were with somebody else, somebody who didn't take everything so hard and who knew how to enjoy herself.	Ses05M-script02-04-01-2_F032.wav	04
Ses01M_script01_3_F012	 I almost got married two years ago.	Ses01M-script01-01-01-3_F012.wav	01
Ses03M_script02_2_M037	 I know.  But I know I don't make you happy.	Ses03M-script02-04-01-2_M037.wav	04
Ses03M_script02_2_F002	 It's PR.  I mean, somebody sold you a good bill about this wonderful event that going to happen on the beach.	Ses03M-script02-05-01-2_F002.wav	05
Ses03M_script02_2_F003	 Yeah.  Everyone else was sold the same thing.  I mean, look, it keeps us excited, it keeps us coming back for more and you know, keeps us thinking life's going to start any minute now.	Ses03M-script02-05-01-2_F003.wav	05
Ses05M_script02_2_M025	 Do you think that I thought there would be times when you would look at me like I was used Kleenex or I would look at you and think, good God, when's the next flight to Alaska?  No.  No, I'm just like you. I thought it would all be like peaches and roses, and sand in our toes, and wind in our hair, and the fish would always come.  And the bills would magically pay themselves.  And we'd have three fat rosy kids.  But, ha ha, baby, the jokes on us!	Ses05M-script02-05-01-2_M025.wav	05
Ses05M_script02_2_M026	 Because you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This.	Ses05M-script02-05-01-2_M026.wav	05
Ses05M_script02_1_M001	 What's that? Is that- Wait, is that foam?  I can't even tell.  Oh Actually, I guess if I can't tell then it probably isn't it, is it?  It will probably be unmistakable, don't you think?	Ses05M-script02-07-01-1_M001.wav	07
Ses03M_script02_2_M028	 Welcome to the human race.	Ses03M-script02-05-01-2_M028.wav	05
Ses05M_script02_1_M009	 Oh, I wonder if they can hear me or if they can feel the vibrations when we move around in the sand. or something	Ses05M-script02-07-01-1_M009.wav	07
Ses01M_script01_1_M040	 Then help me stay.	Ses01M-script01-04-01-1_M040.wav	04
Ses01M_script01_3_F003	 Not sorry, no.  I can't stay here.	Ses01M-script01-04-01-3_F003.wav	04
Ses01M_script01_3_F019	 No, what is it?  Is your mother?	Ses01M-script01-04-01-3_F019.wav	04
Ses01M_script01_3_F022	 Wouldn't work like this.	Ses01M-script01-04-01-3_F022.wav	04
Ses01M_script01_3_F023	 Yeah, sure.	Ses01M-script01-04-01-3_F023.wav	04
Ses03M_script02_1_M005	 Oh, you know what I forgot?  I forgot my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I should've brought my flashlight.	Ses03M-script02-07-01-1_M005.wav	07
Ses01M_script01_3_F025	 [BREATHING]. Geez.	Ses01M-script01-04-01-3_F025.wav	04
Ses01M_script01_3_F026	 Do you still feel that way?	Ses01M-script01-04-01-3_F026.wav	04
Ses03M_script02_1_M014	 God.  Oh, you know what would be good right about now?  A six-pack.  A six-pack would be just the ticket.	Ses03M-script02-07-01-1_M014.wav	07
Ses03M_script02_1_M016	 I wonder if they can hear us talk?  Or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around?	Ses03M-script02-07-01-1_M016.wav	07
Ses05M_script03_1_F013	 If I laugh at everything, then I must laugh at us too.	Ses05M-script03-01-01-1_F013.wav	01
Ses01M_script01_3_M023	 I don't know.	Ses01M-script01-04-01-3_M023.wav	04
Ses05M_script03_1_F017	 What if one of us dies, does the other one laugh then?	Ses05M-script03-01-01-1_F017.wav	01
Ses03M_script02_1_M037	 Somewhere out there, there's this huge silver mass of fish heading this way, they don't why, we don't know why, they just some little instinctual fire cracker went off in their bodies...	Ses03M-script02-07-01-1_M037.wav	07
Ses05M_script03_1_F031	 You knew there was nothing in that.	Ses05M-script03-01-01-1_F031.wav	01
Ses03M_script02_1_M039	 It's single mindedness with no mind.  It's urgency that's pure urge and they don't, they don't ask it a question, they don't give it a name, they just swim.	Ses03M-script02-07-01-1_M039.wav	07
Ses01M_script01_3_M029	 For instance, there was this one time when this kid--it had been raining for like several days and he gave me his last pair of dry socks.	Ses01M-script01-04-01-3_M029.wav	04
Ses01M_script01_3_M031	 They didn't die they killed themselves for each other and I mean that exactly, you know a little more selfish and they'll all be here today...	Ses01M-script01-04-01-3_M031.wav	04
Ses01M_script01_3_M032	 And I had this idea as I was watching them go down like everything was being destroyed, you know.  But I felt like this one new thing was being made, you know it's kind of like this.  This monument...	Ses01M-script01-04-01-3_M032.wav	04
Ses05M_script03_2_F005	 Well, what of it.	Ses05M-script03-01-01-2_F005.wav	01
Ses05M_script03_2_F006	 Well it gave him a lot of pleasure and it didn't hurt me.	Ses05M-script03-01-01-2_F006.wav	01
Ses05M_script03_2_F012	 It's becoming a habit with you.	Ses05M-script03-01-01-2_F012.wav	01
Ses01M_script01_3_M037	 Driving my new car and I felt guilty you know opening my bank book seeing a new refrigerator.	Ses01M-script01-04-01-3_M037.wav	04
Ses03M_script03_2_F004	 Just a little perhaps but nothing serious.	Ses03M-script03-01-01-2_F004.wav	01
Ses03M_script03_2_F012	 It's become a habit with you.	Ses03M-script03-01-01-2_F012.wav	01
Ses05M_script03_2_M010	 Do you want some brandy?	Ses05M-script03-01-01-2_M010.wav	01
Ses01M_script01_3_M041	 I want you to know Annie.	Ses01M-script01-04-01-3_M041.wav	04
Ses03M_script03_2_F017	 That's the woman's job to lure the man.  Watch me a moment won't you?	Ses03M-script03-01-01-2_F017.wav	01
Ses05M_script03_2_M011	 I think I'll have a little.	Ses05M-script03-01-01-2_M011.wav	01
Ses01M_script01_1_F016	 The trouble is those god damn news papers.  Every month some boy comes back missing longer then Larry so--	Ses01M-script01-05-01-1_F016.wav	05
Ses03M_script03_2_M020	 Yes it is.	Ses03M-script03-01-01-2_M020.wav	01
Ses03M_script03_2_M021	 I think that	Ses03M-script03-01-01-2_M021.wav	01
Ses03M_script03_2_F001	 Presents?  A trivial little broach.	Ses03M-script03-05-01-2_F001.wav	05
Ses01M_script01_1_F032	 Do you know what that'll do to you, to your father, do you know?  I don't.	Ses01M-script01-05-01-1_F032.wav	05
Ses05M_script03_2_F043	 Brute	Ses05M-script03-05-01-2_F043.wav	05
Ses03M_script03_2_F025	 They sting.	Ses03M-script03-05-01-2_F025.wav	05
Ses05M_script03_2_M023	 They snap.	Ses05M-script03-05-01-2_M023.wav	05
Ses05M_script03_2_M028	 I do believe that I have said already that I had three minuet liquor glasses of brandy in the entire evening.  A child of two couldn't get drunk of that.	Ses05M-script03-05-01-2_M028.wav	05
Ses01M_script01_1_M035	 Yes, yes I like it for one hour a day.  I don't care if I have to grub for money all day long when I come home I want it nice, I want a family, I want to kids and Annie is in the center of that.	Ses01M-script01-05-01-1_M035.wav	05
Ses05M_script03_2_M031	 You know what?  That's a very good idea.  I think I will.	Ses05M-script03-05-01-2_M031.wav	05
Ses01M_script01_2_F011	 Oh, laugh at me, laugh all you like but why does this happen to very night she comes back?  She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look at it, Joe look.	Ses01M-script01-05-01-2_F011.wav	05
Ses01M_script01_2_F012	 Believe with me Joe, you got to believe. Only last week a boy came back missing longer then Larry you read it yourself.	Ses01M-script01-05-01-2_F012.wav	05
Ses03M_script03_2_M006	 And what about me?	Ses03M-script03-05-01-2_M006.wav	05
Ses05M_script03_2_M038	 Turn it off!	Ses05M-script03-05-01-2_M038.wav	05
Ses05M_script03_2_M039	 Very amusing indeed.	Ses05M-script03-05-01-2_M039.wav	05
Ses01M_script01_2_M017	 What the hell do you want from me, Kate?	Ses01M-script01-05-01-2_M017.wav	05
Ses03M_script03_2_M014	 You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want any yourself at the moment.	Ses03M-script03-05-01-2_M014.wav	05
Ses01M_script01_3_F015	 Because I was waiting for you, Chris.  Till then you never wrote me and then when you did, well, you sure can be ambiguous you know.	Ses01M-script01-07-01-3_F015.wav	07
Ses03M_script03_2_M030	 Okay, like I mentioned before I had three very small, minute liquor glasses of brandy.  That's not even enough to get a child of two drunk.	Ses03M-script03-05-01-2_M030.wav	05
Ses05M_script03_1_F001	 what, Nobody knows we are here except Freda and she wouldn't ring up.	Ses05M-script03-07-01-1_F001.wav	07

Ses05M_script03_1_F004	 It was bound to happen sooner or later.	Ses05M-script03-07-01-1_F004.wav	07
Ses05M_script03_1_F005	 Oh, it sent shivers up my spine.	Ses05M-script03-07-01-1_F005.wav	07
Ses05M_script03_1_F026	 Oh, It burnt my comb and all the towels in the bathroom.	Ses05M-script03-07-01-1_F026.wav	07
Ses03M_script03_2_M041	 Very amusing indeed.	Ses03M-script03-05-01-2_M041.wav	05
Ses05M_script03_1_M006	 Oh, what shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us.	Ses05M-script03-07-01-1_M006.wav	07
Ses01M_script02_1_M037	 We just weren't in a good spot though.	Ses01M-script02-01-01-1_M037.wav	01
Ses05M_script03_1_M009	 things that ought to matter most dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy, do they?	Ses05M-script03-07-01-1_M009.wav	07
Ses05M_script03_1_M010	 Uhh, You mustn't say that, my darling.	Ses05M-script03-07-01-1_M010.wav	07

Ses01M_script02_2_M008	 Can I ask you a question?  Are you on your period?	Ses01M-script02-01-01-2_M008.wav	01
Ses03M_script03_1_M004	 I don't care then.	Ses03M-script03-07-01-1_M004.wav	07
Ses05M_script03_1_M013	 You mustn't be serious, darling.  That's just what they want.	Ses05M-script03-07-01-1_M013.wav	07
Ses01M_script02_2_M020	 Let's see, uh, I took a shower and, um, you were watching the news and you said the "the Grunions are running tonight," and I said "okay great, let's go."	Ses01M-script02-01-01-2_M020.wav	01
Ses05M_script03_1_M018	 No.  That fire will fade along with our passion.	Ses05M-script03-07-01-1_M018.wav	07
Ses04F_impro01_F009	 Okay.  What is it that I did wrong on the form that I have to start all over again?	Ses04F-impro01-05-01-F009.wav	05
Ses01M_script02_2_M023	 It was when we were driving passed that knickerbocker liquor locker and you would said, no you said "let's get some champagne" and I said "no time to wasting" or something like that.  That's what it is, right?	Ses01M-script02-01-01-2_M023.wav	01

Ses01M_script02_1_F017	 Pass what up?  These little fish swim out of the ocean, they flop around on the sand then they swim back and then they die.	Ses01M-script02-05-01-1_F017.wav	05
Ses01M_script02_1_F022	 Last year, you'll also remember we got--our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat, we got into a big fight and we did not see the grunions.	Ses01M-script02-05-01-1_F022.wav	05

Ses01M_script03_2_M022	 You know, it's a pity you didn't have any more brandy. It would have made you just a little less disagreeable.	Ses01M-script03-05-01-2_M022.wav	05
Ses01M_script03_2_M028	 I am not in the least bit drunk.	Ses01M-script03-05-01-2_M028.wav	05

Ses01M_script03_2_M041	 You're not going like this.	Ses01M-script03-05-01-2_M041.wav	05
Ses04F_impro04_M020	 and I want- I mean you know you've got to, like, do your hair.  I mean- I don't know, it's like,	Ses04F-impro04-01-01-M020.wav	01
Ses04F_impro04_M022	 or some- some large percent of- of success.	Ses04F-impro04-01-01-M022.wav	01
Ses01M_script03_1_F031	 Oh, Charles.  That was his name Charles. He did wriggle so beautifully.	Ses01M-script03-07-01-1_F031.wav	07
Ses01M_script03_1_M028	 Let's pity the poor philosophers, huh?  Let's enjoy the party for as long as we can, okay?  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and sit like small idiotic school children. [LAUGHTER]	Ses01M-script03-07-01-1_M028.wav	07
Ses04F_impro04_M030	 I don't know it's like I'm trying to be-	Ses04F-impro04-01-01-M030.wav	01
Ses04F_impro04_M033	 I'm trying to watch TV.	Ses04F-impro04-01-01-M033.wav	01
Ses04F_impro04_F006	 What?  Who says that?  Bananas don't grow overnight.	Ses04F-impro04-05-01-F006.wav	05
Ses02F_impro01_M001	 Okay.  Let me see here.  Um, we need--we need your original birth certificate.	Ses02F-impro01-01-01-M001.wav	01
Ses02F_impro01_F019	 Yeah, but your birth certificate--I mean, who carries around their birth certificate?  Nobody does that.	Ses02F-impro01-05-01-F019.wav	05
Ses02F_impro02_F006	 Their not gonna let you.  You have to stay home and I have to go.  I mean, that's all--	Ses02F-impro02-04-01-F006.wav	04
Ses02F_impro02_F007	 and--I mean, my daughter--I don't want to put her in danger.  You know?  She has to stay.	Ses02F-impro02-04-01-F007.wav	04
Ses04F_impro05_F011	 Look fifty dollars is unacceptable.  My bag itself cost over a hundred and fifty dollars.  You can't just give me fifty dollar gift certificate to Percoes or whatever the hell and then send me off like that's- that's good enough.  Like that's all I needed was fifty dollars.  My bag is worth more than that.	Ses04F-impro05-05-01-F011.wav	05
Ses02F_impro02_F012	 I don't want you in danger.  And I don't want her in danger.	Ses02F-impro02-04-01-F012.wav	04
Ses04F_impro05_F018	 Really, you don't work for anybody.  It's just you?	Ses04F-impro05-05-01-F018.wav	05
Ses04F_impro06_M004	 Well I mean, you know, I mean it was I mean with that kind of condition,	Ses04F-impro06-01-01-M004.wav	01
Ses04F_impro06_M011	 You know I think- I think we should celebrate because I think that's what he would have wanted.	Ses04F-impro06-04-01-M011.wav	04
Ses02F_impro04_M006	 There...There are plenty of people out there with--with like, good jobs, you know, that are a lot...	Ses02F-impro04-01-01-M006.wav	01
Ses02F_impro04_M008	 I know.  It makes it harder.  I mean it's definitely who you know in a lot of cases, but--	Ses02F-impro04-01-01-M008.wav	01
Ses04F_impro07_M020	 Hey, that's cool.	Ses04F-impro07-01-01-M020.wav	01

Ses02F_impro05_F001	 No, it didn't. um It didn't come out and I don't see it anywhere around here, so what can you do about that?	Ses02F-impro05-01-01-F001.wav	01
Ses04F_impro07_M059	 Or library.	Ses04F-impro07-01-01-M059.wav	01
Ses02F_impro05_M002	 Uh, well some-some of the bags were--were lost on the way over here. uh-	Ses02F-impro05-01-01-M002.wav	01
Ses02F_impro05_M006	 Right.  Uh We realize, you know, that that it's a bad situation, but I'm sorry, there's nothing that we can really do.	Ses02F-impro05-01-01-M006.wav	01
Ses04F_impro07_M071	 Yeah, you don't want to do the sorority thing because you'll probably get used and abused by	Ses04F-impro07-01-01-M071.wav	01
Ses02F_impro05_M009	 Yes, I know. I know-. It's It's frustrating.  Unfortunately though-- um	Ses02F-impro05-01-01-M009.wav	01
Ses02F_impro05_M011	 Right, well, by checking in your bags, you agreed to, you know, at the will of the--	Ses02F-impro05-01-01-M011.wav	01
Ses04F_impro07_M082	 that happened, you know, that was going on.	Ses04F-impro07-01-01-M082.wav	01
Ses04F_impro07_F001	 My acceptance letter.	Ses04F-impro07-07-01-F001.wav	07
Ses02F_impro05_M018	 Well, that's--that's what I'm saying--	Ses02F-impro05-01-01-M018.wav	01
Ses04F_impro07_F005	 Big bad acceptance packet with all the information.  I'm going to U.S.C..	Ses04F-impro07-07-01-F005.wav	07
Ses04F_impro07_F006	 I know. [LAUGHTER]	Ses04F-impro07-07-01-F006.wav	07
Ses04F_impro07_F010	 Do you want to buy me some mace for my, you know, going away present?	Ses04F-impro07-07-01-F010.wav	07
Ses02F_impro06_M006	 It's okay.	Ses02F-impro06-01-01-M006.wav	01
Ses04F_impro07_F016	 They have - U.S.C. has everything because U.S.C. is the best school ever.	Ses04F-impro07-07-01-F016.wav	07
Ses04F_impro07_F021	 okay.  Well I'm not going to be undecided forever. [LAUGHTER]	Ses04F-impro07-07-01-F021.wav	07
Ses04F_impro07_F024	 So this works out perfectly.  Because I was worried if I didn't get in to U.S.C., then I would have to go somewhere far away and then-	Ses04F-impro07-07-01-F024.wav	07
Ses04F_impro07_F028	 I know.  We should have a party.	Ses04F-impro07-07-01-F028.wav	07
Ses04F_impro07_F032	 That is why I got accepted.	Ses04F-impro07-07-01-F032.wav	07

Ses02F_impro06_F005	 And his whole family was there.	Ses02F-impro06-04-01-F005.wav	04
Ses02F_impro06_F008	 ...the way he wanted to live and he was gonna go to Africa and he was gonna--	Ses02F-impro06-04-01-F008.wav	04

Ses04F_impro07_M042	 Oh, so well then you know that it's awesome.	Ses04F-impro07-07-01-M042.wav	07
Ses02F_impro07_F024	 I mean I'm gonna take a bunch of stuff and see.	Ses02F-impro07-07-01-F024.wav	07

Ses04F_impro08_F005	 Okay.  Um, and what was the complaint?	Ses04F-impro08-01-01-F005.wav	01
Ses04F_impro08_F008	 Well I'm very sorry, sir.  They should have dealt with it at that particular branch.  I apologize for that, uh, but we can help you.  That's no worries.  We can take care of that.  So how much did you need to be refunded?	Ses04F-impro08-01-01-F008.wav	01

Ses02F_impro07_M011	 Wow. That's cool.	Ses02F-impro07-07-01-M011.wav	07
Ses02F_impro07_M027	 Ahh. Yeah. [GARBAGE]	Ses02F-impro07-07-01-M027.wav	07
Ses04F_script01_2_M001	 Well maybe- maybe he just wanted to see her again.	Ses04F-script01-01-01-2_M001.wav	01
Ses04F_script01_2_M004	 How do you know he's even thinking about it?	Ses04F-script01-01-01-2_M004.wav	01
Ses04F_script01_2_M008	 You can't read her mind.	Ses04F-script01-01-01-2_M008.wav	01
Ses04F_script01_3_F023	 Yeah, sure.	Ses04F-script01-01-01-3_F023.wav	01
Ses04F_script01_3_M008	 I guess you know this is why I asked you to come.	Ses04F-script01-01-01-3_M008.wav	01
Ses02F_impro08_F014	 Yeah.	Ses02F-impro08-01-01-F014.wav	01
Ses02F_impro08_F015	 Okay.	Ses02F-impro08-01-01-F015.wav	01
Ses04F_script01_3_M029	 Just about all.	Ses04F-script01-04-01-3_M029.wav	04
Ses04F_script01_3_M030	 It takes a lot of time to toss that off because they weren't just men.	Ses04F-script01-04-01-3_M030.wav	04
Ses02F_impro08_F021	 All right.  Great.  Well we have a very open flight that leaves at nine a.m. and fortunately uh the time change actually goes um backwards from that.	Ses02F-impro08-01-01-F021.wav	01
Ses04F_script01_3_M033	 They didn't die.  They killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today.	Ses04F-script01-04-01-3_M033.wav	04
Ses02F_impro08_F024	 And a there will also be a shuttle waiting for you to take you to the appropriate hotel.	Ses02F-impro08-01-01-F024.wav	01
Ses02F_impro08_M005	 You- You can do that--You can do that now? I don't have to get like transferred through or anything like that.	Ses02F-impro08-01-01-M005.wav	01
Ses04F_script01_3_M043	 when you drive the new car, you have to know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've got to be a little better because of that.	Ses04F-script01-04-01-3_M043.wav	04
Ses02F_impro08_M007	 All right.  I want to make sure it's like a nice hotel--I mean-mean I'm gonna be paying a lot of money for this so I don't wanna-I don't wanna, you know, I don't wanna to be a waste of time.	Ses02F-impro08-01-01-M007.wav	01
Ses04F_script01_3_M044	 Otherwise what you have is really just loot and there's blood on it.  I didn't want to take any of it.	Ses04F-script01-04-01-3_M044.wav	04
Ses04F_script01_1_F012	 You can't say that to him.	Ses04F-script01-05-01-1_F012.wav	05
Ses04F_script01_1_F014	 To you it is and to me but not to him.  You can talk yourself blue in the face but there's no body and no grave so where are you?	Ses04F-script01-05-01-1_F014.wav	05
Ses04F_script01_1_F022	 I ignore what I got to ignore. The girl is Larry's girl.	Ses04F-script01-05-01-1_F022.wav	05
Ses02F_impro08_M018	 All right.  So we're confirmed then or do you--All right.	Ses02F-impro08-01-01-M018.wav	01
Ses02F_impro08_M019	 Okay.	Ses02F-impro08-01-01-M019.wav	01
Ses04F_script01_1_F035	 Are you crazy?	Ses04F-script01-05-01-1_F035.wav	05
Ses04F_script01_1_F037	 Must you be inspired?	Ses04F-script01-05-01-1_F037.wav	05
Ses02F_script01_1_M029	 Because it is.	Ses02F-script01-01-01-1_M029.wav	01
Ses02F_script01_1_F004	 Did you talk to him?	Ses02F-script01-04-01-1_F004.wav	04
Ses04F_script01_1_M029	 So what I'm not fast with women.	Ses04F-script01-05-01-1_M029.wav	05
Ses02F_script01_1_F017	 I've got an idea, but what's the story?	Ses02F-script01-04-01-1_F017.wav	04
Ses02F_script01_1_M027	 Well, if she does, then that's the end of it.  But from her letters, I think she's forgotten him.  I'll find out.  And then we'll thrash it out with Dad, right?  Mom, don't avoid me.	Ses02F-script01-04-01-1_M027.wav	04
Ses04F_script01_2_F005	 What's going on here, Joe?	Ses04F-script01-05-01-2_F005.wav	05
Ses02F_script01_3_F021	 You've gotta tell me.	Ses02F-script01-04-01-3_F021.wav	04
Ses02F_script01_3_F022	 It wouldn't work this way.	Ses02F-script01-04-01-3_F022.wav	04
Ses02F_script01_3_F023	 Yeah, sure.	Ses02F-script01-04-01-3_F023.wav	04
Ses04F_script02_2_F008	 We totally skipped. Right.	Ses04F-script02-01-01-2_F008.wav	01
Ses02F_script01_3_M025	 Just about all.	Ses02F-script01-04-01-3_M025.wav	04
Ses02F_script01_3_M026	 It takes some time for a guy to toss that off.  'Cause they weren't just men.	Ses02F-script01-04-01-3_M026.wav	04
Ses04F_script02_2_M019	 Wait a minute.  I've got it.	Ses04F-script02-01-01-2_M019.wav	01
Ses02F_script01_3_M028	 They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today.	Ses02F-script01-04-01-3_M028.wav	04
Ses04F_script02_2_M020	 It was in the car right.  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said let's get some champagne and I said times a wasting or something like that.  Right?	Ses04F-script02-01-01-2_M020.wav	01
Ses04F_script02_2_M044	 I don't know.  It seemed like a good spot to me.	Ses04F-script02-01-01-2_M044.wav	01
Ses04F_script02_2_M047	 It's not champagne.	Ses04F-script02-01-01-2_M047.wav	01
Ses04F_script02_2_F019	 We thought I was pregnant and we had a bottle of champagne but no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  So we took off our shoes	Ses04F-script02-04-01-2_F019.wav	04
Ses02F_script01_3_M034	 Because otherwise all you have is really loot and there's blood on it.  And I didn't want to take any of it.  And I guess that included you.	Ses02F-script01-04-01-3_M034.wav	04
Ses04F_script02_2_F026	 No.	Ses04F-script02-04-01-2_F026.wav	04
Ses04F_script02_2_F037	 I know you are, Augie.  Really I do.  I know you wanted this to be special and nice and it's the full moon and the sand and all but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.	Ses04F-script02-04-01-2_F037.wav	04
Ses02F_script01_1_M011	 Why shouldn't he dream of him and walk the nights waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore?  That we haven't had hope for years now?	Ses02F-script01-05-01-1_M011.wav	05
Ses04F_script02_1_F008	 There is no point in coming down here.	Ses04F-script02-05-01-1_F008.wav	05

Ses04F_script02_1_F017	 Yes.	Ses04F-script02-05-01-1_F017.wav	05
Ses02F_script01_2_F013	 But why did that happen the very night she came here?  She sleeps in his room and his memorial breaks to pieces.  Just look.  Look at it.	Ses02F-script01-05-01-2_F013.wav	05
Ses04F_script02_1_F019	 We didn't see them the first time either.	Ses04F-script02-05-01-1_F019.wav	05
Ses04F_script02_1_F021	 About what?	Ses04F-script02-05-01-1_F021.wav	05
Ses04F_script02_2_F007	 For heaven's sake, this is not about fish.	Ses04F-script02-05-01-2_F007.wav	05
Ses04F_script02_2_F009	 For heaven's sake, grow up we are not going to see the Grunions.	Ses04F-script02-05-01-2_F009.wav	05
Ses02F_script02_1_M010	 Right, of course.  Our flashlight.  Mine and yours.  I mean, me flashlight is su flashlight naturally.	Ses02F-script02-01-01-1_M010.wav	01

Ses04F_script02_1_M021	 Think about the people in Kansas.  They'd have to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to come see this.  We're just forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up.	Ses04F-script02-07-01-1_M021.wav	07
Ses04F_script02_1_M026	 like the swallows returning to Capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs, like that.  There's mystery here and magic	Ses04F-script02-07-01-1_M026.wav	07
Ses04F_script02_1_M037	 It's single mindedness with no mind.  Urgency that's pure urge.	Ses04F-script02-07-01-1_M037.wav	07
Ses04F_script02_1_M038	 They don't know what drives them.  They don't give it a name or ask question.  They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them here to this place	Ses04F-script02-07-01-1_M038.wav	07
Ses04F_script03_1_M030	 How long did that row last?	Ses04F-script03-01-01-1_M030.wav	01
Ses04F_script03_1_M031	 The worst one was in Cannes when your curling irons burnt holes in my dressing gown.	Ses04F-script03-01-01-1_M031.wav	01
Ses04F_script03_2_M000	 As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.	Ses04F-script03-01-01-2_M000.wav	01
Ses04F_script03_2_F013	 Oh, don't be so stupid.	Ses04F-script03-05-01-2_F013.wav	05

Ses02F_script02_2_F011	 I mean, I feel like my whole life is gonna be spent standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for the fish to show up.  And the fish won't show up.	Ses02F-script02-05-01-2_F011.wav	05
Ses02F_script02_1_M000	 What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight.	Ses02F-script02-07-01-1_M000.wav	07
Ses02F_script02_1_M001	 This is great, isn't it?  Look at the night we've got here, couldn't be better.	Ses02F-script02-07-01-1_M001.wav	07
Ses04F_script03_2_F039	 Stop, stop.  I hate you.  Do you hear?  You're conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible.	Ses04F-script03-05-01-2_F039.wav	05
Ses02F_script02_1_M005	 Well, I guess we can tell, it probably isn't right?  Probably be unmistakable don't you think?	Ses02F-script02-07-01-1_M005.wav	07
Ses04F_script03_2_F044	 I'd rather die in torment. Beast.  Brute.  Calf swine.	Ses04F-script03-05-01-2_F044.wav	05
Ses04F_script03_2_M007	 What about me?	Ses04F-script03-05-01-2_M007.wav	05
Ses02F_script02_1_M028	 Alright.  But it's fish that do something that none of the other fish do.  Like the swallows returning to Capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs.	Ses02F-script02-07-01-1_M028.wav	07
Ses02F_script02_1_M035	 There is that--no that's just seaweed isn't it?	Ses02F-script02-07-01-1_M035.wav	07
Ses04F_script03_2_M031	 Very good idea.  I will.	Ses04F-script03-05-01-2_M031.wav	05
Ses02F_script03_1_F015	 Well, shall we always want to bicker and fight?	Ses02F-script03-01-01-1_F015.wav	01
Ses04F_script03_1_F005	 Ahh.  It sent shivers up my spine.	Ses04F-script03-07-01-1_F005.wav	07

Ses02F_script03_1_M005	 Hello?  Hello?  What?  Wrong number.	Ses02F-script03-01-01-1_M005.wav	01
Ses04F_script03_1_F014	 Oh, how long will it last, this ludicrous, over-bearing love of ours?	Ses04F-script03-07-01-1_F014.wav	07
Ses02F_script03_1_M014	 Flippancy brings out the acid in their damn sweetness and light.	Ses02F-script03-01-01-1_M014.wav	01
Ses04F_script03_1_F026	 It burnt my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom.	Ses04F-script03-07-01-1_F026.wav	07
Ses04F_script03_1_F029	 How ridiculous.  How utterly, utterly ridiculous.	Ses04F-script03-07-01-1_F029.wav	07
Ses02F_script03_1_M018	 Depends on how well we've played.	Ses02F-script03-01-01-1_M018.wav	01
Ses04F_script03_1_F030	 And very much sillier.	Ses04F-script03-07-01-1_F030.wav	07
Ses04F_script03_1_M007	 With the most perfect poise.	Ses04F-script03-07-01-1_M007.wav	07
Ses04F_script03_1_M008	 Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy, do they?	Ses04F-script03-07-01-1_M008.wav	07
Ses02F_script03_1_M028	 How long did that row last?	Ses02F-script03-01-01-1_M028.wav	01
Ses04M_impro01_M000	 Yeah, hi.  Um, look, I -- all I'm trying to do right now is renew my license plate.  That's all.  I just need to get one of those little stickers.	Ses04M-impro01-01-01-M000.wav	01
Ses02F_script03_2_F012	 Well, it's become a habit with you.	Ses02F-script03-01-01-2_F012.wav	01

Ses04M_impro04_F002	 Have you gone, like, signed up with a temp agency?  Maybe they can help.	Ses04M-impro04-01-01-F002.wav	01
Ses04M_impro04_F005	 Well, I mean, if it's that bad, maybe you're gonna have to take something that doesn't really fit, you know.  Like maybe you'll have to do something else for a while.  Find a new field, new skill.	Ses04M-impro04-01-01-F005.wav	01
Ses04M_impro04_F006	 Well then you're choosing to be unemployed, really.	Ses04M-impro04-01-01-F006.wav	01

Ses02F_script03_1_M022	 Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.  Let's blow our trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as much as we can.  Like quite idiotic, very small school children.  Let's savor the delight of the moment.	Ses02F-script03-07-01-1_M022.wav	07
Ses04M_impro04_F013	 You didn't do what I told you to do.	Ses04M-impro04-01-01-F013.wav	01

Ses04M_script01_2_F003	 Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.	Ses04M-script01-05-01-2_F003.wav	05
Ses02M_impro08_F008	 Uh, I don't know where it came from and it's actually quite large, and I don't have the money for it so	Ses02M-impro08-01-01-F008.wav	01
Ses02M_impro08_F010	 Okay, it was um- at the [GARBAGE] sorry, it was at a department store, I think it was Macy's or something	Ses02M-impro08-01-01-F010.wav	01
Ses04M_script01_2_F008	 She's not his girl, Joe.  She knows she's not.	Ses04M-script01-05-01-2_F008.wav	05

Ses04M_script01_2_F012	 I want you to act like he's coming back, both of you.  Don't think I haven't noticed you since he invited her here.  I won't stand for any nonsense.	Ses04M-script01-05-01-2_F012.wav	05
Ses02M_impro08_M004	 pretend like your on a rotary phone, goes straight through to a person.	Ses02M-impro08-01-01-M004.wav	01
Ses02M_impro08_M005	 I know they don't tell you that kind of thing.	Ses02M-impro08-01-01-M005.wav	01
Ses04M_script02_1_M005	 Whose is it?	Ses04M-script02-01-01-1_M005.wav	01
Ses04M_script02_1_M012	 You want my jacket?	Ses04M-script02-01-01-1_M012.wav	01
Ses02M_impro08_M012	 So- So you can um find that application. You have the Internet, you can go to our website.	Ses02M-impro08-01-01-M012.wav	01

Ses02M_impro08_M014	 We could mail it to you as well, but-	Ses02M-impro08-01-01-M014.wav	01
Ses04M_script02_1_M015	 That's my point, too.	Ses04M-script02-01-01-1_M015.wav	01
Ses02M_impro08_M017	 Right. I mean we might	Ses02M-impro08-01-01-M017.wav	01
Ses04M_script02_2_F018	 Dancing barefoot in the sand; drinking champagne from the bottle.	Ses04M-script02-04-01-2_F018.wav	04
Ses02M_impro08_M021	 so it is a little a little hard in that situation if you want -- you know you can -um- we can- we can issue another credit card.	Ses02M-impro08-01-01-M021.wav	01
Ses04M_script02_2_F019	 I'd rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for some things.	Ses04M-script02-04-01-2_F019.wav	04
Ses02M_impro08_M024	 Yeah. yeah.	Ses02M-impro08-01-01-M024.wav	01
Ses02M_impro08_M028	 if you're ever online or anything like that I mean just make sure it's a secure site and	Ses02M-impro08-01-01-M028.wav	01
Ses04M_script02_1_F007	 It's after eleven; let's go home.	Ses04M-script02-05-01-1_F007.wav	05
Ses02M_script01_1_F018	 Well, you want to make sure that your father isn't-	Ses02M-script01-01-01-1_F018.wav	01
Ses04M_script02_2_F006	 Goddamn it, Augie, don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  You always ask me that.  It's insulting.	Ses04M-script02-05-01-2_F006.wav	05
Ses02M_script01_1_F023	 You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong with that.	Ses02M-script01-01-01-1_F023.wav	01
Ses02M_script01_1_M018	 I'm going to ask her to marry me.	Ses02M-script01-01-01-1_M018.wav	01
Ses04M_script02_2_M034	 No, I know, me neither.	Ses04M-script02-05-01-2_M034.wav	05
Ses04M_script02_1_M001	 Actually, I wanted to go a little farther up the coast, get away from the lights and the people, but I was afraid we'd miss it.  How you doing?	Ses04M-script02-07-01-1_M001.wav	07
Ses04M_script02_1_M002	 Is that, is that - is that just foam?  I can't even tell.  Although, if you can't tell, it's probably isn't them.  It'll probably be unmistakable, don't you think?	Ses04M-script02-07-01-1_M002.wav	07
Ses04M_script02_1_M003	 How you doing?  Oh, no, you know what I did?  I forgot to bring my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I should have brought my flashlight.	Ses04M-script02-07-01-1_M003.wav	07
Ses02M_script01_1_M005	 I could hear him right through the floor in my room.	Ses02M-script01-04-01-1_M005.wav	04
Ses02M_script01_1_M028	 I don't know, I'll find out. Then we'll trash it out with dad, right? Mom, don't avoid me.	Ses02M-script01-04-01-1_M028.wav	04
Ses02M_script01_1_M036	 I'll get out. I'll get married and go live some place else, maybe New York.	Ses02M-script01-04-01-1_M036.wav	04
Ses04M_script02_1_M031	 They're swimming right now as if that's the only thing that matters.  It's single mindedness with no mind.  Urgency that's pure urge.	Ses04M-script02-07-01-1_M031.wav	07
Ses02M_script01_3_F027	 I mean, and your money, there's- there's nothing wrong with your money.  I mean, your father put hundreds of planes in the air.  A man should be paid for that.	Ses02M-script01-04-01-3_F027.wav	04
Ses04M_script02_1_M032	 They don't know what drives them.  They don't give it a name or ask a question.  They just turn, as one, and start the swim that brings them here; to this place, where we stand, for a massive celebration of sex and death.  Oh, man, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  All my hairs are popping up.	Ses04M-script02-07-01-1_M032.wav	07
Ses04M_script02_1_M033	 Well so what did you think?	Ses04M-script02-07-01-1_M033.wav	07
Ses02M_script01_3_M022	 Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going from me.	Ses02M-script01-04-01-3_M022.wav	04
Ses02M_script01_3_M025	 Well, I lost them.	Ses02M-script01-04-01-3_M025.wav	04
Ses04M_script03_1_M012	 You mustn't be serious, my dear.  That's just what they want.	Ses04M-script03-01-01-1_M012.wav	01
Ses02M_script01_3_M030	 I got this idea watching 'em go down.  Everything was being destroyed, see, but it seemed that one new thing was made.  A sort of responsibility.  Man for man. You know what I mean?	Ses02M-script01-04-01-3_M030.wav	04
Ses04M_script03_1_M013	 All the futile moralists who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.  Laugh at everything.  All their sacred shibboleths.  Flippancy brings out the acid- acid in their damn sweetness and light.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-1_M013.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_F000	 That was the first time you ever hit me.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_F000.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_F010	 What of it?	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_F010.wav	05
Ses02M_script01_1_F035	 Must you be inspired?	Ses02M-script01-05-01-1_F035.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_F014	 No, thanks.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_F014.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_F019	 What?	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_F019.wav	05
Ses02M_script01_1_M012	 We've got to say it to him.	Ses02M-script01-05-01-1_M012.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_F022	 Oh, no, it isn't.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_F022.wav	05
Ses02M_script01_1_M024	 I don't know why but every time I reach out for something that I really want, I have to pull back 'cause someone else will suffer. My whole bloody life, time after time after time.	Ses02M-script01-05-01-1_M024.wav	05
Ses02M_script01_1_M039	 Yes, I like it and hour a day. If I'm going to grub for money all day long, at least in the evening I want it beautiful.	Ses02M-script01-05-01-1_M039.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_F035	 Not very funny, dear.  You'd better have some more brandy.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_F035.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_F039	 Turn it on again, please.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_F039.wav	05
Ses02M_script01_2_M016	 What does that mean, me above all?	Ses02M-script01-05-01-2_M016.wav	05
Ses02M_script01_2_M017	 Look at you -- look at you shaking.	Ses02M-script01-05-01-2_M017.wav	05
Ses02M_script02_1_F017	 Yes.	Ses02M-script02-01-01-1_F017.wav	01
Ses04M_script03_2_M008	 You must admit that he was in love with you, wasn't he?	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M008.wav	05
Ses02M_script02_1_F021	 About what?	Ses02M-script02-01-01-1_F021.wav	01
Ses04M_script03_2_M012	 What about me?	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M012.wav	05
Ses02M_script02_2_M001	 What I was saying.	Ses02M-script02-01-01-2_M001.wav	01
Ses02M_script02_2_M021	 Yea. Okay, sure, no. I see. Listen, you want to dance?	Ses02M-script02-01-01-2_M021.wav	01
Ses04M_script03_2_M031	 They snap.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M031.wav	05
Ses02M_script02_2_F015	 Do you remember the first time we came to see it? It was about four years ago right after we got married.	Ses02M-script02-04-01-2_F015.wav	04
Ses04M_script03_2_M033	 I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more then, hmm?	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M033.wav	05
Ses02M_script02_2_F017	 And when we were dancing you said the softest most intimate things to me right into my ears so I could feel them as much as hear them	Ses02M-script02-04-01-2_F017.wav	04
Ses04M_script03_2_M034	 You must have had a riotous time.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M034.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_M036	 I'm not in the least drunk.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M036.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_M038	 Very interesting.  And how about a child of four and a child of six and a child of nine?	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M038.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_M041	 You better turn that off I think.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M041.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_M043	 There are people downstairs, I suppose	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M043.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_M047	 Turn it off.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M047.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_M051	 You're not going like this.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M051.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_M053	 Shut up. Shut up.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M053.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_2_M056	 Whore.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_M056.wav	05
Ses02M_script02_1_M004	 Is that -- is that, no? Was that just foam? I can't even tell.	Ses02M-script02-07-01-1_M004.wav	07
Ses04M_script03_1_F018	 Well that's serious enough, isn't it?	Ses04M-script03-07-01-1_F018.wav	07
Ses02M_script02_1_M023	 Honey, this is a natural phenomenon. I mean it only happens once a year.	Ses02M-script02-07-01-1_M023.wav	07
Ses02M_script02_1_M024	 Think about the people in Kansas, they- they'd have to get a plane ticket and hotel reservations to see this. We live forty minutes away it's too good to pass up.	Ses02M-script02-07-01-1_M024.wav	07
Ses04M_script03_1_F024	 I know you did.  You threw it out of the window into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.	Ses04M-script03-07-01-1_F024.wav	07
Ses02M_script02_1_M029	 you know there is like, there is a certain mystery here, a magic, a bit of the unexplainable. I don't see how you cannot be interested.	Ses02M-script02-07-01-1_M029.wav	07
Ses02M_script02_1_M035	 There is that, oh no that's just seaweed, isn't it?	Ses02M-script02-07-01-1_M035.wav	07
Ses02M_script02_1_M040	 It's single mindedness, with no mind, it's urgency that's pure urge, they don't know what drives them. They don't ask it a name or ask it a question,	Ses02M-script02-07-01-1_M040.wav	07
Ses02M_script03_2_F002	 No it wasn't. It was very pretty I still have it and I wear it often.	Ses02M-script03-01-01-2_F002.wav	01
Ses05F_impro01_M003	 Well, I have no camera here.  I can't help you at all here, ma'am.  I have forms for something completely different.  You need to go to a different place.	Ses05F-impro01-01-01-M003.wav	01
Ses02M_script03_2_F006	 It gave him a lot of pleasure, it didn't hurt me any.	Ses02M-script03-01-01-2_F006.wav	01
Ses02M_script03_2_F007	 Well, if you hadn't been so nosey and suspicious you never wouldn't have known anything about it.	Ses02M-script03-01-01-2_F007.wav	01
Ses02M_script03_2_F009	 No thanks.	Ses02M-script03-01-01-2_F009.wav	01
Ses02M_script03_2_F012	 Well, it's become a habit with you.	Ses02M-script03-01-01-2_F012.wav	01
Ses05F_impro02_F009	 I know.  I know.	Ses05F-impro02-04-01-F009.wav	04
Ses02M_script03_2_M012	 You can hardly call three liquor glasses in a whole evening going on and on and on.	Ses02M-script03-01-01-2_M012.wav	01
Ses05F_impro02_F012	 I think infantry.  I'm not sure.	Ses05F-impro02-04-01-F012.wav	04
Ses02M_script03_2_M018	 As a matter of fact, that's perfectly true.	Ses02M-script03-01-01-2_M018.wav	01
Ses05F_impro02_F021	 I don't think there's anything we can do.	Ses05F-impro02-04-01-F021.wav	04
Ses02M_script03_2_M032	 All right. I will.	Ses02M-script03-01-01-2_M032.wav	01
Ses02M_script03_1_M009	 Oh darling don't say that.	Ses02M-script03-04-01-1_M009.wav	04
Ses05F_impro02_F029	 We'll figure something out.  We just have to ... we just have to think about this.  Could any of your family help us?	Ses05F-impro02-04-01-F029.wav	04
Ses05F_impro02_M024	 I'll tell them I'm sick and that you can't leave something.	Ses05F-impro02-04-01-M024.wav	04
Ses02M_script03_2_F038	 Stop it. Stop it. I hate you, do you hear? You're overbearing and conceited and utterly impossible.	Ses02M-script03-05-01-2_F038.wav	05
Ses02M_script03_2_F040	 Oh yes I am.	Ses02M-script03-05-01-2_F040.wav	05
Ses05F_impro02_M033	 Yeah.  I guess.  I don't know what they're going to say.	Ses05F-impro02-04-01-M033.wav	04
Ses05F_impro02_M036	 All the time, every day, every day.  They have e-mail over there and stuff like that, right? I can send you pictures.	Ses05F-impro02-04-01-M036.wav	04
Ses02M_script03_2_M039	 Turn it off.	Ses02M-script03-05-01-2_M039.wav	05
Ses02M_script03_2_M044	 You're not.	Ses02M-script03-05-01-2_M044.wav	05
Ses05F_impro03_F002	 Yeah.	Ses05F-impro03-07-01-F002.wav	07
Ses02M_script03_1_F002	 What are we going to do?	Ses02M-script03-07-01-1_F002.wav	07
Ses05F_impro03_F011	 Sorry.	Ses05F-impro03-07-01-F011.wav	07
Ses02M_script03_1_M014	 flippancy brings out the acid in their damned sweetness in light.	Ses02M-script03-07-01-1_M014.wav	07
Ses02M_script03_1_M018	 Yes, yes, with all his might.	Ses02M-script03-07-01-1_M018.wav	07
Ses05F_impro03_M000	 What?	Ses05F-impro03-07-01-M000.wav	07
Ses03F_impro02_F000	 How's it going, babe?	Ses03F-impro02-01-01-F000.wav	01
Ses03F_impro02_F001	 Yeah?	Ses03F-impro02-01-01-F001.wav	01
Ses05F_impro03_M031	 And now you're getting married.	Ses05F-impro03-07-01-M031.wav	07
Ses03F_impro02_F012	 yeah	Ses03F-impro02-04-01-F012.wav	04
Ses05F_impro03_M039	 Of course, of course she will ... of course she will.  Yeah, don't go and disappear like everyone else after they get married and I never see them again.  That'll make me mad.  You don't want to make me mad.  You know how I get when I get mad.	Ses05F-impro03-07-01-M039.wav	07
Ses03F_impro02_F019	 But it- it is for a year.	Ses03F-impro02-04-01-F019.wav	04
Ses03F_impro02_F021	 You know as much as -as much as me that I-I want to stay here with you and Amy so bad, but I can't.	Ses03F-impro02-04-01-F021.wav	04
Ses03F_impro02_F023	 Babe, I love you.	Ses03F-impro02-04-01-F023.wav	04
Ses05F_impro03_M046	 I can't believe it.	Ses05F-impro03-07-01-M046.wav	07

Ses05F_impro04_F043	 yeah.	Ses05F-impro04-01-01-F043.wav	01
Ses03F_impro02_F032	 I will come back.	Ses03F-impro02-04-01-F032.wav	04
Ses03F_impro02_F041	 I didn't expect this to happen. I never planned for this. Some things you just don't plan for, you know.	Ses03F-impro02-04-01-F041.wav	04
Ses05F_impro04_M012	 Well, what are you going to do about it to make it different?	Ses05F-impro04-01-01-M012.wav	01
Ses03F_impro02_M018	 I don't know if I can handle you going another year.	Ses03F-impro02-04-01-M018.wav	04
Ses05F_impro04_M016	 Well, just don't give up. And there's- you know, You never know, something might be around the corner tomorrow.	Ses05F-impro04-01-01-M016.wav	01
Ses03F_impro02_M031	 All right, then.	Ses03F-impro02-04-01-M031.wav	04
Ses05F_impro04_M027	 And you've got to think--well, ask yourself why are they not hiring you?	Ses05F-impro04-01-01-M027.wav	01
Ses03F_impro02_F007	 Well umm- actually they--I was promoted.	Ses03F-impro02-07-01-F007.wav	07
Ses03F_impro03_F004	 at the end of the performance, you know, like we're all clapping and stuff. And all of a sudden I look over and	Ses03F-impro03-07-01-F004.wav	07
Ses03F_impro03_F005	 Joe's gone. -where did he go, you know?	Ses03F-impro03-07-01-F005.wav	07
Ses05F_impro04_M033	 Do they give you any specifics as to why they didn't go with you?	Ses05F-impro04-01-01-M033.wav	01
Ses03F_impro03_F008	 goes up there and everyone's clapping and he's standing there and they put a spotlight on him.	Ses03F-impro03-07-01-F008.wav	07
Ses05F_impro04_M037	 Everyone wants to be a working actor, but they all work at something else.	Ses05F-impro04-01-01-M037.wav	01
Ses03F_impro03_F017	 It was--I cried,	Ses03F-impro03-07-01-F017.wav	07
Ses05F_impro04_M043	 You know I'll always help you.	Ses05F-impro04-01-01-M043.wav	01
Ses05F_impro04_F000	 Brian, I need help.	Ses05F-impro04-04-01-F000.wav	04
Ses05F_impro04_F016	 Where am I supposed to go?  I mean, like what?	Ses05F-impro04-04-01-F016.wav	04
Ses03F_impro03_M005	 yeah [LAUGHTER]	Ses03F-impro03-07-01-M005.wav	07
Ses05F_impro04_F019	 I'm just worried.	Ses05F-impro04-04-01-F019.wav	04
Ses03F_impro04_M003	 If you really want to do it-I mean,	Ses03F-impro04-01-01-M003.wav	01
Ses05F_impro05_F002	 It was Virgin Atlantic coming from London.	Ses05F-impro05-01-01-F002.wav	01
Ses03F_impro04_M008	 You are, you're going to class, you're learning, you're getting better. When you finally get that role you're going to be prepared.	Ses03F-impro04-01-01-M008.wav	01
Ses03F_impro04_M009	 Oh my God, Anna, you're still young. Don't even think about that.	Ses03F-impro04-01-01-M009.wav	01
Ses05F_impro05_M002	 From London, okay. Um- And you went through all your proper checkpoints?	Ses05F-impro05-01-01-M002.wav	01
Ses03F_impro04_M017	 Maybe you could start teaching. I don't know.	Ses03F-impro04-01-01-M017.wav	01
Ses05F_impro05_M009	 Well, as I told you, it left Heath Row and it seems to have arrived here.  But if you can't find it, then-are you sure you know what your bag looks like?	Ses05F-impro05-01-01-M009.wav	01
Ses05F_impro05_M012	 Are you sure?	Ses05F-impro05-01-01-M012.wav	01
Ses05F_impro05_M015	 Sentimental value.	Ses05F-impro05-01-01-M015.wav	01
Ses03F_impro05_M008	 and when you sign your ticket we could replace about fifteen percent of what's in the bag.	Ses03F-impro05-01-01-M008.wav	01
Ses03F_impro05_M011	 I think that's kind of stupid, that you put a hundred thousands of dollars in the bag.	Ses03F-impro05-01-01-M011.wav	01
Ses05F_impro05_M025	 Well, we're talking about one bag.  You personally made it here, didn't you?	Ses05F-impro05-01-01-M025.wav	01
Ses05F_impro05_M032	 Well, it's like any kind of insurance.  You don't-when you get it, then you get more. You know, Like if you--	Ses05F-impro05-01-01-M032.wav	01
Ses03F_impro05_F009	 And what if- what if it is lost? Well, what are you guys going to do for me?	Ses03F-impro05-05-01-F009.wav	05
Ses05F_impro05_M034	 Uh, so it was really heavy.	Ses05F-impro05-01-01-M034.wav	01
Ses03F_impro05_F016	 Give me--I'm going to talk to your supervisor. Give me your supervisor. I want to talk to your supervisor right now.	Ses03F-impro05-05-01-F016.wav	05
Ses03F_impro06_M003	 yeah.	Ses03F-impro06-01-01-M003.wav	01
Ses05F_impro05_M051	 So you'd like the fifty dollar voucher?	Ses05F-impro05-01-01-M051.wav	01
Ses03F_impro06_F001	 Yeah. Wow.	Ses03F-impro06-04-01-F001.wav	04
Ses03F_impro06_F003	 It's weird 'cause it's like you expected it to happen and eventually-	Ses03F-impro06-04-01-F003.wav	04
Ses03F_impro06_F012	 so wrong in so many ways.	Ses03F-impro06-04-01-F012.wav	04
Ses05F_impro06_M010	 Is he an actor too, or-?	Ses05F-impro06-01-01-M010.wav	01
Ses03F_impro06_F015	 I know. He was, he had so much going for him.	Ses03F-impro06-04-01-F015.wav	04
Ses05F_impro06_M018	 Cool, Well, If you want me to go with you, I will.	Ses05F-impro06-01-01-M018.wav	01
Ses05F_impro06_M019	 No problem.	Ses05F-impro06-01-01-M019.wav	01
Ses05F_impro06_M021	 yeah.	Ses05F-impro06-01-01-M021.wav	01
Ses03F_impro06_F023	 He was like, he was like my brother, you know.	Ses03F-impro06-04-01-F023.wav	04
Ses03F_impro06_F024	 He was my brother.	Ses03F-impro06-04-01-F024.wav	04
Ses05F_impro06_M024	 Absolutely.	Ses05F-impro06-01-01-M024.wav	01
Ses05F_impro06_F001	 Oh they had some pretty progressive cancer,	Ses05F-impro06-04-01-F001.wav	04
Ses05F_impro06_F002	 metastasized and it was old and they knew that it wasn't looking good, but-	Ses05F-impro06-04-01-F002.wav	04
Ses03F_impro06_F030	 so I was there for him.	Ses03F-impro06-04-01-F030.wav	04
Ses03F_impro06_F031	 Yeah. God, I loved that kid.	Ses03F-impro06-04-01-F031.wav	04
Ses05F_impro06_F005	 Kind of.	Ses05F-impro06-04-01-F005.wav	04
Ses05F_impro06_F006	 It's hard to watch when it's painful for them, you know.	Ses05F-impro06-04-01-F006.wav	04
Ses03F_impro06_M002	 I didn't know him, Tricia, but uh- I heard that he was a great man.	Ses03F-impro06-04-01-M002.wav	04
Ses05F_impro06_F012	 I feel really bad for his family, you know.	Ses05F-impro06-04-01-F012.wav	04
Ses03F_impro06_M010	 Some people.	Ses03F-impro06-04-01-M010.wav	04
Ses05F_impro06_F020	 Thanks.	Ses05F-impro06-04-01-F020.wav	04
Ses05F_impro06_F021	 It's really bizarre, you know, when you know somebody really well, and then...	Ses05F-impro06-04-01-F021.wav	04
Ses05F_impro06_F023	 really hard to imagine that like you're going to continue to live, and that person's just going to have stopped.	Ses05F-impro06-04-01-F023.wav	04
Ses03F_impro06_M016	 I'm sure he loved you too. He just didn't know it.	Ses03F-impro06-04-01-M016.wav	04
Ses03F_impro07_F015	 We're not twenty one yet, but whatever.	Ses03F-impro07-01-01-F015.wav	01
Ses03F_impro07_F031	 That's going to--that'll be reserved for somebody else.	Ses03F-impro07-01-01-F031.wav	01
Ses05F_impro06_F026	 It's hard to say good-bye.	Ses05F-impro06-04-01-F026.wav	04
Ses05F_impro06_M002	 That's the worst.  I'm so sorry.  Did you know him well?	Ses05F-impro06-04-01-M002.wav	04
Ses05F_impro06_M005	 Absolutely, absolutely.	Ses05F-impro06-04-01-M005.wav	04
Ses03F_impro07_M033	 Well, get used to it.	Ses03F-impro07-01-01-M033.wav	01
Ses05F_impro06_M007	 There's no reason for it.	Ses05F-impro06-04-01-M007.wav	04
Ses05F_impro07_F000	 So guess what.	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-F000.wav	07
Ses03F_impro07_F021	 Awesome. We're both going to be in L.A.	Ses03F-impro07-07-01-F021.wav	07
Ses05F_impro07_F002	 U.S.C..	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-F002.wav	07
Ses05F_impro07_F005	 I'll stay in town.	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-F005.wav	07
Ses03F_impro07_F029	 Yeah. Those little-- --mattresses. I'll put it by my bed.	Ses03F-impro07-07-01-F029.wav	07
