Ses02M_impro02_F004	 It's dangerous; I mean how can you make sure that you'll	Ses02M-impro02-04-01-F004.wav	04
Ses01M_impro05_M026	 It'll be a lot more than what you're doing sitting here and just give me lip service.  I'd like to go back at least do some aggressive searching for my stuff.	Ses01M-impro05-05-01-M026.wav	05
Ses02M_script01_3_F008	 Well, from her point of view, why else would I come?	Ses02M-script01-01-01-3_F008.wav	01
Ses02F_impro04_M004	 I know.  I know. It's hard, but you just--you gotta keep going.  I mean, you've been going at it for so long, you know.  Something is definitely going to come up.  I-I know it will, because you're a good worker--	Ses02F-impro04-01-01-M004.wav	01
Ses01F_script01_3_M025	 It's just all mixed up with so many other things, you know?  You know overseas I was in command of a company?	Ses01F-script01-04-01-3_M025.wav	04
Ses02F_impro04_M016	 Right.	Ses02F-impro04-01-01-M016.wav	01
Ses03M_impro04_M000	 I'm just so tired all the time.	Ses03M-impro04-04-01-M000.wav	04
Ses02F_impro08_M006	 [BREATHING] that's good.	Ses02F-impro08-01-01-M006.wav	01
Ses04M_script01_1_M037	 The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.	Ses04M-script01-05-01-1_M037.wav	05
Ses05F_impro02_M015	 It doesn't make any sense.  It's stupid.  I told you you shouldn't go in the Army.	Ses05F-impro02-05-01-M015.wav	05
Ses01F_script01_1_M003	 I don't know.	Ses01F-script01-01-01-1_M003.wav	01
Ses02M_impro06_M006	 God, it's you know, we've spent so much time with them it's just really surreal, really weird that we're not going to be able to see her anymore and go	Ses02M-impro06-04-01-M006.wav	04
Ses02M_impro07_M006	 but big packet, big packet is nice	Ses02M-impro07-07-01-M006.wav	07
Ses05M_impro08_M023	 Absolutely. And I just don't want that to happen to you anymore.	Ses05M-impro08-01-01-M023.wav	01
Ses05M_impro07_M024	 Well, I don't know.  I've got to go look for a place.	Ses05M-impro07-07-01-M024.wav	07
Ses05F_impro07_F038	 Woo-	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-F038.wav	07
Ses05F_impro04_M031	 Do they seem to like you? I mean, Can you get any read from them?	Ses05F-impro04-01-01-M031.wav	01
Ses04M_impro07_F003	 know you applied to U.S.C..	Ses04M-impro07-07-01-F003.wav	07
Ses04F_impro01_F004	 I did exactly what they told me to do.	Ses04F-impro01-05-01-F004.wav	05
Ses01M_impro06_F005	 Oh Jesus.	Ses01M-impro06-04-01-F005.wav	04
Ses05M_script03_1_M012	 Um What does it all mean?  That's what I ask myself in my endless quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God, what does it all mean?	Ses05M-script03-07-01-1_M012.wav	07
Ses05M_script01_1_M025	 To hell with that!	Ses05M-script01-05-01-1_M025.wav	05
Ses01M_impro03_M015	 It's a good idea.	Ses01M-impro03-07-01-M015.wav	07
Ses03M_impro07_F016	 Man I'm just so happy for you.  I just--	Ses03M-impro07-07-01-F016.wav	07
Ses05F_script01_1_M016	 You know why I asked Annie here, don't you?	Ses05F-script01-04-01-1_M016.wav	04
Ses05F_impro07_F031	 you'd be that kid	Ses05F-impro07-07-01-F031.wav	07
Ses05M_impro08_M018	 Okay?  Does it list your IP address there?	Ses05M-impro08-01-01-M018.wav	01
Ses03M_script02_1_M043	 About what I just said?	Ses03M-script02-07-01-1_M043.wav	07
Ses02F_impro04_M003	 No, come on.  Don't [GARBAGE]	Ses02F-impro04-01-01-M003.wav	01
Ses04M_script03_2_F030	 Mind your own business.	Ses04M-script03-05-01-2_F030.wav	05
Ses04F_script03_1_F007	 Certainly I shall probably do a court curtsy.	Ses04F-script03-07-01-1_F007.wav	07
Ses04M_script03_2_F009	 Let him kiss you.	Ses04M-script03-01-01-2_F009.wav	01
Ses03F_impro05_F008	 Not to mention I have my work in there.	Ses03F-impro05-05-01-F008.wav	05
Ses04M_impro06_M011	 This is just -- this is a terrible life.  I just don't understand.	Ses04M-impro06-04-01-M011.wav	04
Ses04F_impro07_M051	 Are you going to take out loans or-	Ses04F-impro07-01-01-M051.wav	01
Ses03M_script01_1_F040	 Tell me something.  You can leave this business?	Ses03M-script01-04-01-1_F040.wav	04
Ses02F_impro08_M015	 Uh, well, yeah, I think we were just--you know, whenever best available, I guess.  You know--	Ses02F-impro08-01-01-M015.wav	01
Ses05F_impro02_M014	 I don't understand why they would just do something like this?	Ses05F-impro02-05-01-M014.wav	05
Ses04F_script02_2_F014	 and the fish won't show up.	Ses04F-script02-05-01-2_F014.wav	05
Ses02F_script03_1_M023	 Come and kiss me, darling, before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.	Ses02F-script03-07-01-1_M023.wav	07
Ses04M_script02_2_M001	 What I said.	Ses04M-script02-01-01-2_M001.wav	01
Ses02M_script01_3_M015	 Ann, why didn't you let me know?	Ses02M-script01-07-01-3_M015.wav	07
Ses01F_impro05_F028	 Okay.  I'll do that.	Ses01F-impro05-05-01-F028.wav	05
Ses05F_script01_1_F005	 He cried hard.	Ses05F-script01-04-01-1_F005.wav	04
Ses02M_impro02_M002	 and	Ses02M-impro02-04-01-M002.wav	04
Ses04M_script03_2_M009	 Line?	Ses04M-script03-01-01-2_M009.wav	01
Ses04F_script03_2_M006	 What of it?	Ses04F-script03-05-01-2_M006.wav	05
Ses04F_impro07_M019	 So you're undecided?	Ses04F-impro07-01-01-M019.wav	01
Ses05M_impro05_F013	 Chances are it's probably just you know -- taking time being um- unloaded from the airplane.	Ses05M-impro05-01-01-F013.wav	01
Ses03F_script03_2_F041	 Oh, yes I am.	Ses03F-script03-05-01-2_F041.wav	05
Ses03F_script02_2_F026	 No.	Ses03F-script02-04-01-2_F026.wav	04
Ses01M_script01_3_M033	 You know, that they were bringing something on to this earth, a kind of sacrifice you know.	Ses01M-script01-04-01-3_M033.wav	04
Ses05M_impro07_M030	 yeah?	Ses05M-impro07-07-01-M030.wav	07
Ses02M_impro06_F010	 And she was	Ses02M-impro06-04-01-F010.wav	04
Ses05F_impro05_F005	 Yeah.	Ses05F-impro05-01-01-F005.wav	01
Ses05F_impro06_F011	 Yeah, he kind of did a lot of things, but we acted together, sometimes.	Ses05F-impro06-04-01-F011.wav	04
Ses04F_script03_2_M001	 I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.	Ses04F-script03-05-01-2_M001.wav	05
Ses05F_impro05_M000	 Okay, what flight were you on?	Ses05F-impro05-01-01-M000.wav	01
Ses03M_script01_1_M047	 No you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.	Ses03M-script01-04-01-1_M047.wav	04
Ses05M_impro07_M023	 yeah.	Ses05M-impro07-07-01-M023.wav	07
Ses04F_impro04_F031	 I thought I was pretty clear about what the problem was.	Ses04F-impro04-05-01-F031.wav	05
Ses03F_script02_1_M001	 Look at the night we got; couldn't be better.	Ses03F-script02-07-01-1_M001.wav	07
Ses04F_impro07_M066	 Fine.  It's dorky.	Ses04F-impro07-01-01-M066.wav	01
Ses05F_impro04_F040	 Yeah.	Ses05F-impro04-01-01-F040.wav	01
Ses03M_script02_2_F018	 We thought I was pregnant.	Ses03M-script02-04-01-2_F018.wav	04
Ses02F_script02_2_F033	 I know that, Augie.  Really, I do.	Ses02F-script02-04-01-2_F033.wav	04
Ses05M_impro06_M011	 And now I don't have that person anymore, you know.  And it's -- -- it's just, you.	Ses05M-impro06-04-01-M011.wav	04
Ses03F_script03_2_M030	 Okay. As I mentioned before, I said I had three very minute liquor glasses. That's hardly enough to get a child of two drunk.	Ses03F-script03-05-01-2_M030.wav	05
Ses02M_script02_2_M015	 You were fine during the phone call from Marge, dinner was okay, doing the dishes was no problem, let's see, I took a shower, you watched the news, you said	Ses02M-script02-01-01-2_M015.wav	01
Ses03F_impro02_F026	 No, I have to go.	Ses03F-impro02-04-01-F026.wav	04
Ses05F_impro02_F024	 Well, apparently nobody else can go.	Ses05F-impro02-04-01-F024.wav	04
Ses05F_impro04_F042	 Would you be willing to make some more calls on my behalf? I won't--I won't make you look bad.	Ses05F-impro04-04-01-F042.wav	04
Ses05M_impro07_M037	 So it comes Indian like. And you know I'm kind of smart, so.	Ses05M-impro07-07-01-M037.wav	07
Ses02M_script03_2_M016	 Going out somewhere, dear?	Ses02M-script03-01-01-2_M016.wav	01
Ses03M_impro03_M013	 Come on. It was her birthday.	Ses03M-impro03-07-01-M013.wav	07
Ses04M_script02_2_F013	 I did want to see it.  I always do.  I keep thinking this time will be the time, but it never is.	Ses04M-script02-05-01-2_F013.wav	05
Ses03M_script03_2_M044	 Just shut up.	Ses03M-script03-05-01-2_M044.wav	05
Ses04M_script03_1_F030	 And very much sillier.	Ses04M-script03-07-01-1_F030.wav	07
Ses05F_impro05_M008	 Well, I'm not a miracle worker.  I don't know what I can do for you.  I don't have the bag right here.	Ses05F-impro05-01-01-M008.wav	01
Ses02F_script02_2_M035	 I know, me neither.	Ses02F-script02-04-01-2_M035.wav	04
Ses02M_script02_1_F006	 I'm cold.	Ses02M-script02-01-01-1_F006.wav	01
Ses04M_script02_2_M021	 It was in the car, right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker?  You said let's get some champagne and I said times a wasting or something like that.  Right?  That's it, right?  You want this to be like the other time.  That's it.  Of course.	Ses04M-script02-01-01-2_M021.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_3_M039	 And I went to work with dad and that rat race again. And I felt what you said-ashamed somehow. Because nobody was changed at all. It seemed to make a sucker out of a lot of guys.	Ses03F-script01-04-01-3_M039.wav	04
Ses01M_script01_1_M023	 To hell with that.	Ses01M-script01-05-01-1_M023.wav	05
Ses05M_script03_1_F003	 Now and always, my sweet.	Ses05M-script03-07-01-1_F003.wav	07
Ses01F_script01_1_F005	 He's dreaming of him again, walking around.	Ses01F-script01-01-01-1_F005.wav	01
Ses03M_impro05b_F007	 Well sir, if if...what I believe has happened is most of the flight was left--	Ses03M-impro05b-01-01-F007.wav	01
Ses03F_script01_3_M042	 And I didn't want to take any of it.	Ses03F-script01-04-01-3_M042.wav	04
Ses02F_impro05_M013	 Well, there are-there are some shops here in- in the airport--	Ses02F-impro05-01-01-M013.wav	01
Ses01M_impro06_M000	 Yeah, I'm just-- yeah	Ses01M-impro06-04-01-M000.wav	04
Ses04M_impro04_F003	 Right, but you have -- I mean, you have to keep on them.  You have to keep calling and reminding them that you're still looking and	Ses04M-impro04-01-01-F003.wav	01
Ses04M_impro06_M006	 I mean, they're, you know, they're upset.  It's like you know, they	Ses04M-impro06-04-01-M006.wav	04
Ses05F_script02_2_M002	 It certainly is not. It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.	Ses05F-script02-01-01-2_M002.wav	01
Ses01F_impro02_F005	 I know.	Ses01F-impro02-04-01-F005.wav	04
Ses03F_script02_1_M009	 We should have brought our flashlight. I can't believe we forgot to bring it.	Ses03F-script02-07-01-1_M009.wav	07
Ses05M_impro03_F002	 When?	Ses05M-impro03-07-01-F002.wav	07
Ses03F_impro04_M000	 Hey, you just got to keep on going.	Ses03F-impro04-01-01-M000.wav	01
Ses04F_impro07_M073	 Yeah.	Ses04F-impro07-01-01-M073.wav	01
Ses04M_script01_1_M032	 Yeah, let's keep going.	Ses04M-script01-01-01-1_M032.wav	01
Ses04F_impro07_F074	 Oh, oh, I'm sorry, my bad.  I'll have to, like, sign up for summer lessons from you before I go.  You can teach me how to be cool before I go to college.	Ses04F-impro07-07-01-F074.wav	07
Ses03M_impro06_M018	 I was supposed to see him last summer	Ses03M-impro06-04-01-M018.wav	04
Ses04F_script03_1_F009	 It's true the whole business is very poor joke.	Ses04F-script03-07-01-1_F009.wav	07
Ses01F_impro02_F013	 You'll videotape everything, yeah?	Ses01F-impro02-04-01-F013.wav	04
Ses03M_impro02_F025	 What could happen in a year?	Ses03M-impro02-04-01-F025.wav	04
Ses04M_impro06_F000	 Hey, how you doing?	Ses04M-impro06-04-01-F000.wav	04
Ses05F_impro06_F022	 something happens and they die and it's like-	Ses05F-impro06-04-01-F022.wav	04
Ses03F_script01_2_F016	 Look at it. Because why, when she came here and she slept in his room, the memorial broke into pieces. Look at it, look at it, Joe.	Ses03F-script01-05-01-2_F016.wav	05
Ses04M_script01_2_F015	 She goes to sleep in his bed and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look.  Look at it.  Joe--	Ses04M-script01-05-01-2_F015.wav	05
Ses02F_impro07_F008	 ...hang out and, like, have our different lives--And meet each other's friends and stuff.  So, I'm just so glad 'cause they have such a good school	Ses02F-impro07-07-01-F008.wav	07
Ses04M_impro08_M004	 Okay.	Ses04M-impro08-01-01-M004.wav	01
Ses03M_impro08b_M004	 Oh.  I'm sorry. Um- Did you drop it in water?	Ses03M-impro08b-01-01-M004.wav	01
Ses03F_impro01_M001	 Oh, um-	Ses03F-impro01-01-01-M001.wav	01
Ses02M_script01_1_M037	 I've been a good son too long a good sucker, I'm through with it.	Ses02M-script01-05-01-1_M037.wav	05
Ses02M_script01_2_F000	 Why did he invite her here?	Ses02M-script01-05-01-2_F000.wav	05
Ses03F_script03_2_M015	 Really, Amanda.	Ses03F-script03-05-01-2_M015.wav	05
Ses01M_script02_1_M040	 Out there, there's like this big mass of silver fish they're heading this way...	Ses01M-script02-07-01-1_M040.wav	07
Ses04F_impro07_F064	 [LAUGHTER].	Ses04F-impro07-07-01-F064.wav	07
Ses01M_impro02_F010	 What about the birthday party?	Ses01M-impro02-04-01-F010.wav	04
Ses04M_script01_3_F023	 Oh, gees.	Ses04M-script01-04-01-3_F023.wav	04
Ses02M_impro06_F013	 Are you going to be okay?	Ses02M-impro06-04-01-F013.wav	04
Ses03M_impro03_F024	 You marry me. I man I Jane, you Tarzan.	Ses03M-impro03-07-01-F024.wav	07
Ses02F_impro04_M001	 No.  You can't think that way.  I mean it's good--it's good that you're--that you're calling, you know. you can't	Ses02F-impro04-01-01-M001.wav	01
Ses02F_script01_3_M027	 For instance, one time, it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks.  I put them in pocket.  It's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had.	Ses02F-script01-04-01-3_M027.wav	04
Ses03M_script01_3_M028	 Well I lost them.	Ses03M-script01-04-01-3_M028.wav	04

Ses02F_script02_1_M039	 all as one, this time release instinctual little firecracker went off and they all turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming.  And they're swimming right now as if that's all that matters.	Ses02F-script02-07-01-1_M039.wav	07
Ses04M_script01_2_F005	 It's got that about it.	Ses04M-script01-05-01-2_F005.wav	05
Ses03M_impro03_F003	 Chuck E. Cheese?  Ah, man that is so lame.	Ses03M-impro03-07-01-F003.wav	07
Ses01F_impro04_M027	 Yes.  One less car at a time.	Ses01F-impro04-01-01-M027.wav	01
Ses03F_impro08_F005	 Well, um- we have a little problem with the system going on.  One of our satellites is down, and I-	Ses03F-impro08-01-01-F005.wav	01
Ses05M_script02_1_M033	 Well, so what do you think?	Ses05M-script02-07-01-1_M033.wav	07
